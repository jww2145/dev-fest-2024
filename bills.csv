Bill,Summary,Issues
Changing Filibuster Rules to Pass Democracy Reforms,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) filed a procedural motion to allow H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, to pass the Senate with a simple majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority normally needed to overcome a filibuster. The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would be the most significant pro-democracy legislation in the U.S. in half a century. It would restore and modernize the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the Supreme Court undermined in Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, and it would update them to better address the modern forms of voter suppression seen in hundreds of anti-voter bills filed in state legislatures across the country during the last two years. This legislation would also protect free and fair elections by safeguarding and expanding voter access, banning partisan gerrymandering, modernizing voter registration, strengthening our campaign finance system, protecting election integrity, and promoting security of election systems. Everyone’s right to be heard and counted in the political process is essential to the functioning of our democracy and protection of our environment, and far too often it is people of color and frontline communities who are targeted by restrictive voting laws and gerrymandering–the same communities most impacted by climate change and environmental injustice. Ensuring that voters have access to the ballot box and their voices are not drowned out by outsized corporate interests would better equip the people to hold politicians accountable and safeguard meaningful public health and environmental protections. On January 19, the Senate upheld the ruling of the chair, sustaining the filibuster and blocking the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, by a vote of 52-48 (Senate roll call vote 10). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Thomas Confirmation (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Joe Biden’s nomination of Holly A. Thomas to serve as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is one of the nation’s most powerful courts, with jurisdiction over more land and more people than any other court except the United States Supreme Court. Federal judges serve for life and the laws that protect our environment and democracy are only as strong as the judges who uphold and enforce them. Before becoming a judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Thomas litigated in prestigious governmental and nonprofit positions to advance fair employment and housing, LGBTQ+ rights, and school desegregation, among other important causes. As a Black woman and as a career public-interest lawyer, Thomas brings personal and professional diversity to a judiciary that has long been dominated by White male judges appointed after careers in private law firms or as prosecutors. On January 20, the Senate confirmed Thomas to be a Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 48-40 (Senate roll call vote 11). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Jackson Confirmation (Supreme Court),"The Senate considered President Joe Biden’s nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court exercises extraordinary authority over all levels of government and areas of public policy, including climate, clean water, democracy, and civil rights. Like all federal judges, Supreme Court justices serve for life, and environmental laws are only as strong as the judges who uphold them. Jackson was previously appointed by President Biden to serve as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and by President Barack Obama to serve both as a district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and as the vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission. During her time at the Sentencing Commission, it took concrete action to reduce mass incarceration and ameliorate longstanding racist sentencing disparities related to the war on drugs. As a district judge, Jackson issued rulings in favor of disability rights, labor rights, immigrants’ rights, and a congressional subpoena related to the first impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. Jackson is the first Black woman and first former public defender ever to serve on the Supreme Court, and the first Supreme Court nominee in decades to have been confirmed by the Senate on three prior occasions. On April 7, the Senate confirmed Jackson to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States by a vote of 53-47 (Senate roll call vote 134). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Expanding Dirty and Dangerous Offshore Drilling,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) sponsored a motion to instruct (MTI) Senate conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, to force the Biden-Harris administration to immediately develop a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan that includes a minimum of 10 region-wide oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. This damaging MTI not only contradicts the necessity to act on climate change and protect coastal communities and wildlife, but it also circumvents the careful, participatory statutory process used to develop the five-year plan. The oil and gas industry has already stockpiled millions of acres of unused leases, and new leases that are sold would not start producing for years or decades, thus having no impact on current oil prices. On May 4, the Senate approved the Barrasso MTI by a vote of 53-44 (Senate roll call vote 148). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Portions of the underlying bill, though none mandating completion of a five-year plan or a minimum of lease sales, were included in the final  Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) & Science Act (H.R. 4346) that the president signed into law on August 9.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Oceans"
Undermining International Climate Commitments,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) sponsored a motion to instruct (MTI) Senate conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, to eliminate international-focused provisions included in the House-passed America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2021, including an $8 billion authorization for the Green Climate Fund, the establishment of a State Department program to provide adaptation, mitigation, and security assistance to under-resourced countries, a professed commitment to implementing the Paris climate agreement and addressing climate change, and the establishment of a State Department task force to coordinate a whole-of-government response to climate change. As the wealthiest nation in the world and one of the largest historical emitters of climate pollution, the U.S. has an obligation to swiftly advance our own clean energy transition through all the tools at our disposal, and to contribute our fair share to support under-resourced countries in meeting our shared climate goals – all of which this amendment would undermine. On May 4, the Senate rejected the Lee MTI by a vote of 48-49 (House Roll Call 150). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. While this MTI was rejected, the crucial climate provisions it sought to eliminate were not ultimately included in the  Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) & Science Act (H.R. 4346), the final version of this bill which the president signed into law on August 9. ",Climate
Hampering Presidential Emergency Actions on Climate,"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored a motion to instruct (MTI) to Senate conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, which would undermine the president’s authority to declare a national, major disaster, or public health emergency, or to invoke the authorities of the Defense Production Act because of climate change. At a moment where we do find ourselves in a climate emergency, we must be able to use all the available tools to tackle this crisis, including these important presidential emergency powers. On May 4 the Senate agreed to Senator Capito’s MTI by a vote of 49-47 (House roll call vote 157). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. While agreed to here, these attacks on presidential emergency powers were not included in the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) & Science Act (H.R. 4346), the final version of this bill which the president signed into law on August 9.","Climate, Clean Energy"
Restoring the Right to Abortion Access,"Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sponsored S. 4132, the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022, to prohibit governmental restrictions on providing and accessing abortion services. For nearly 50 years, the U.S. Constitution protected the right to abortion. The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the venerable precedent of Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in the nation’s history, removed a constitutional right. The people most impacted by the loss of this fundamental right are the same people who bear the greatest burdens from the climate crisis, environmental injustice, and voter suppression: communities of color, communities with low wealth, and rural communities. This legislation would create a statutory right to abortion access, restoring federal protections against state-level abortion bans. Additionally, near majority support for this bill in the Senate highlights the extreme decisions of the current Supreme Court majority, that has also undermined protections for the environment, democracy, and racial justice. On May 11, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 4132 by a vote of 49-51 (Senate roll call vote 170). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Undercutting Public Input and Environmental Review,"Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) sponsored S.J. Res 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) that would undermine core provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act’s (NEPA) implementation, namely regulations that were restored by President Joe Biden. In 2020, the Trump administration severely rolled back long-standing NEPA regulations, seeking to entrench federal climate denial, hastily permit dangerous or polluting projects, and systematically disenfranchise low-income, rural, and communities of color from government decision making. The Biden-Harris administration’s rule restored basic elements of the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations, including consideration of climate change and cumulative impacts of projects on communities, because they are critically important to addressing the climate crisis and environmental justice. On August 4, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 55 by a vote of 50-47 (Senate roll call vote 283). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House did not take action on this resolution in 2022.","Environmental Justice, Climate Change; Other"
Elimination of Superfund Tax,"Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that would strike the Superfund tax included in the bill and replace it with a one-year extension of the 2019 State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction limitation. Reinstating the Superfund tax on polluters, which previously expired in 1995, will help the Environmental Protection Agency better fund and accelerate the cleanup of Superfund sites across the country. Superfund sites are primarily former industrial sites awaiting remediation that are the most heavily contaminated and likely to threaten public health and are disproportionately located near communities of color and communities with low wealth. Since the modest Superfund tax on polluters expired and the trust funded by the tax dried up, so too did the funding for and pace of these critical cleanups. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Graham amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 289). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Environmental Justice, Toxics, Clean Air and Clean Water"
Mandatory Oil and Gas Leasing on Public Lands,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to mandate unnecessary onshore oil and gas drilling lease sales. The amendment would result in hundreds of thousands of acres of public land being offered for lease, including land with low or no potential for development, land far from existing infrastructure, and land near endangered species habitats. For years to come, this amendment would lock up public land that could be managed for conservation, recreation, or other public good. The oil and gas industry has already stockpiled millions of acres of unused leases, and new leases that are sold would not start producing for years or decades, thus having no impact on current oil prices. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Barrasso amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 291). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Public Lands/Forests"
Striking EPA Funding for Climate Action,"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that would strike a provision in the IRA that provides funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority. This funding would not have added any new regulatory authority to the EPA, and it complied with the Supreme Court’s repeated rulings - including in their 2022 West Virginia v. EPA decision - that greenhouse gasses are air pollutants that may be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The EPA is in the process of developing a series of critical greenhouse gas, environmental, and public health regulations, and this funding would aid this critical work. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Capito amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 293). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Subsequent, but unrelated to this failed vote, the provision to provide additional EPA funding was stricken via a budgetary point of order due to the rules governing budget reconciliation.","Climate Change, Clean Air"
Undermining Bedrock Environmental Statutes,"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that would significantly undercut and weaken multiple bedrock environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. In effect, the amendment would expedite permitting for oil and gas and other polluting projects, while threatening the health and safety of frontline communities and the environment. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Capito amendment by a vote of 49-50 (Senate roll call vote 300). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice, Clean Air and Clean Water, Other"
Eliminating Cost-saving Home Energy Efficiency Program,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which would eliminate $460 million from the Home Owner Managing Energy Savings (HOMES) rebate program administered by state governments and instead direct the funding to local governments as general supplemental payments. The HOMES program helps residents make their homes more energy efficient and less costly to run and maintain comfortable indoor temperatures by providing increasing amounts of rebates for increasing percentages of energy saved: for a 35% reduction in energy use, a homeowner could get up to $4,000 in rebates, or up to $8,000 for low- and moderate-income homeowners. Redirecting funding from emissions reductions to general purpose would significantly reduce the benefits the bill would have for U.S. households and their energy bills, and our environment. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 49-51 (Senate roll call vote 305). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Clean Energy, Other"
Undermining Environmental Review and Mandating Coal Leasing,"Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to mandate approval of any coal lease application for which a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process has commenced regardless of health, environmental, or economic impacts. Eliminating the requirement of adequate environmental review and public input, as required by NEPA, would only further harm communities on the frontlines of coal mining, processing, transporting, and burning, as well as our climate and public lands. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Shelby amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 306). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice, Climate Change, Public Lands/Forests"
Restarting Construction of the Harmful Border Wall,"Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to replace the funding for the Office of the Chief Readiness Support Officer with a $500 million appropriation for fencing and barriers along the U.S. southern border. This amendment would have continued to waste taxpayer dollars on a hateful and harmful border wall. It would have exacerbated damage to border communities and the environment they depend on, which includes some of the most fragile and sensitive public lands in the U.S., habitat for imperiled species, and vital migration routes for wildlife. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Sullivan amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 320). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Environmental Justice"
Anti-Climate Fossil Fuel Industry Handouts,"The Senate considered en bloc amendment 5487 to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that included  anti-environment amendments from Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Rob Portman (R-OH). These amendments would strike royalty rates for oil and gas extracted from public lands and waters, drastically limit consumer and vehicle eligibility for the clean vehicle tax credits, cut funding for recovery from climate disasters, exempt oil, gas, and coal companies from the newly created corporate minimum tax, and cut assistance to states to modernize their energy codes and lower families’ utility bills. On August 7, the Senate rejected en bloc amendment 5487 by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 321). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Clean Energy, Dirty Energy, Transportation, Climate Change"
Transformational Climate Investments (Inflation Reduction Act),"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, introducing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to invest roughly $369 billion in climate, clean energy, good jobs, and environmental justice, marking the single largest investment in climate action in U.S. history. The bill incentivizes clean renewable energy, domestic manufacturing, clean vehicles, innovative technologies, and energy efficiency that will save families hundreds of dollars annually, are tied to strong labor provisions, and include added incentives to invest in low-income and fossil-fuel impacted communities. This bill also made a historic $60 billion investment in environmental justice programs, including Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, Clean Ports, Reconnecting Communities, Superfund tax reinstatement, and a methane emissions fee and reductions. At the same time, this bill includes provisions requiring oil and gas lease sales that, if successfully bid upon and subsequently approved for drilling, could subject frontline communities to further harm and are inconsistent with our climate and justice goals. Taken as a whole, however, the IRA is a once-in-a-generation bill that makes transformational investments to protect the planet from current and future climate devastation. On August 7, the Senate approved H.R. 5376, as amended, by a vote of 51- 50, with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote (Senate roll call vote 325). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The president signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law on August 16.","Climate Change, Clean Energy, Clean Air, Environmental Justice"
Ratifying Kigali Treaty to Cut Climate Superpollutants,"After being transmitted to the U.S. Senate by President Joe Biden, the upper chamber considered the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, a United Nations treaty reached in 2016 to significantly phase down the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons – highly potent greenhouse gasses found in air-conditioning systems, insulation, and refrigerators. The amendment also requires signatory parties to establish a licensing system for import and export of hydrofluorocarbons. On September 21, the Senate agreed to the resolution of ratification by a vote of 69-27 (Senate roll call vote 343). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. With this vote, the United States became the 137th country to ratify this treaty. The Environmental Protection Agency had previously issued rules to reduce these climate super-pollutants in line with the treaty’s requirements.",Climate
Disclosing Money in Politics,"Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) sponsored S. 4822, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act of 2022, which would expand the prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals and require additional disclosures of campaign expenditures and certain political advertisements. Undisclosed and unlimited secret campaign contributions by fossil fuel interests threaten both our environment and our democracy. They distort our politics and drown out communities of color and communities with low wealth – who are most impacted by the climate crisis and pollution – by giving even more power to polluters and the super wealthy. Supreme Court decisions such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission severely limit Congress’ ability to enact many common-sense limits on money in politics, and this legislation would make significant strides in ensuring the people can see where that money comes from. On September 22, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 4822 by a vote of 49-49 (Senate roll call vote 346). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Freeman Confirmation (Third Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Joe Biden’s nomination of Arianna J. Freeman to serve as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit is the most powerful federal court in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware besides the Supreme Court. Federal judges serve for life and the laws that protect our environment and democracy are only as strong as the judges who uphold and enforce them. Prior to her judicial service, Freeman was a long-serving federal public defender in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia. Public defenders are a critical bulwark for civil rights and civil liberties in a criminal justice system with pervasive racial disparities. As the first Black woman ever to serve on the Third Circuit, and as a career public-interest lawyer, Freeman brings personal and professional diversity to a judiciary that has long been dominated by White male judges appointed after careers in private law firms or as prosecutors. On September 29, the Senate confirmed Freeman to be a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by a vote of 50-47 (Senate Roll Call Vote 350). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Protecting Marriage Equality,"The Senate considered H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, as amended, to protect same-sex and interracial marriages under federal law; to require states to accord full faith and credit to out-of-state marriages without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin; and to provide for enforcement of the right to marriage equality. The rights to same-sex and interracial marriages are protected by the United States Constitution under landmark Supreme Court precedents including Loving v. Virginia, United States v. Windsor, and Obergefell v. Hodges. However, in 2022 the Supreme Court removed a constitutional right for the first time in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended the right to abortion access. The decision in Dobbs, as well as Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion explicitly calling for the Court to “reconsider” Obergefell, led House Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and others to propose statutory protections for the right to marriage equality. Additionally, majority support for this bill in Congress highlights the extreme decisions of the current Supreme Court majority, that has also undermined protections for the environment, democracy, and racial justice. On November 29, the Senate approved H.R. 8404 by a vote of 61-36 (Senate roll call vote 362). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House approved the Senate-amended H.R. 8404 on December 8, and the president signed this legislation into law on December 13.",Justice and Democracy
Undermining Environmental Review and Mandating Gas Pipeline,"Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) sponsored the Building American Energy Security Act, which was included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023, which had been inserted into H.R. 7776, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). This amendment would allow a broad spectrum of energy-related projects to short circuit environmental review and public input, curtail judicial review, hand project developers veto power over comment period extensions, and require agencies to approve the unnecessary and harmful methane gas Mountain Valley Pipeline, among other damaging actions. Taken together, these changes would further prioritize the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our climate and the health of communities of color and low-wealth communities already disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel extraction, pipelines, processing, and burning. Research indicates that robust public engagement early in project development is more likely to improve projects’ designs, completion timelines, and benefits to communities than shortchanging environmental review and public input. On December 15, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on NDAA with the Manchin amendment by a vote of 47-47 (Senate roll call vote 394). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The Senate subsequently passed the NDAA without Manchin’s legislation on December 15, and the president signed the NDAA into law on December 23.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice, Other"
Certifying Arizona’s Electoral Votes,"Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) objected to the certification of Arizona’s electoral college votes in the 2020 presidential election, peddling unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud. The former president’s and members of Congress’ repeated lies about the election results directly led to the January 6 white supremacist insurrection that stormed the U.S. Capitol and resulted in multiple deaths. Efforts to use lies and conspiracy theories to overturn an election undermine the fundamental democratic principles of our nation and are in direct conflict with the constitutional duties of members of Congress. On January 6, the Senate rejected the objection to Arizona’s electoral college votes by a vote of 6-93 (Senate roll call vote 1). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Arizona’s electoral votes were certified.",Justice and Democracy

Buttigieg Confirmation (Transportation Secretary),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Pete Buttigieg to serve as transportation secretary. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring that the nation has a safe and efficient transportation system. The transportation sector is now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., and most of these emissions come from passenger vehicles. Under the secretary’s leadership, comprehensive rulemaking, funding, and other actions can help to reduce emissions and drive us to a zero-emission future. Prior to his nomination, Buttigieg advocated for clean, place-based transportation at the local level. Buttigieg also made history as the first openly gay nominee to serve as a Cabinet secretary. On February 2, the Senate confirmed Buttigieg to be secretary of transportation by a vote of 86-13 (Senate roll call vote 11). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Other, Transportation"
Promoting Drilling for Fossil Fuels,"Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 5, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution, which would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) from proposing rules or guidance that would ban fracking, a destructive process of oil and gas drilling, in the United States -- an authority that the EPA and CEQ do not currently have. This was a symbolic amendment, demonstrating a desire to keep us addicted to fossil fuels. On February 4, the Senate approved the Braun amendment by a vote of 57-43 (Senate roll call vote 28). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.The Braun amendment was not included in the final S. Con. Res.5, which was approved by the House on February 5.  ","Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Supporting the Destructive Keystone XL Pipeline,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 5, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution, which would keep the Keystone XL pipeline alive at the bequest of oil and gas CEOs. The Keystone XL pipeline would threaten numerous waterways, drinking water sources, and Indigenous lands across the Great Plains, and undercut the credibility and influence of the United States when urging other countries to take ambitious climate action, ultimately undermining U.S. climate leadership. The United States must exercise vigorous climate leadership to achieve a significant increase in global climate action and put the world on a sustainable climate pathway. On February 5, the Senate approved the Daines amendment by a vote of 52-48 (Senate roll call vote 32). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The Daines amendment was not included in the final S. Con. Res. 5, which was approved by the House on February 5.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice"
Bolstering the Dirty Water Rule,"Senator Shelley Capito (R-WV) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 5, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution, which threatened to lock in place the Trump administration’s dangerous “Dirty Water Rule” and prohibit the EPA from crafting stronger regulations to protect critical waterways like our streams and wetlands. The Dirty Water Rule represented the most severe weakening of federal Clean Water Act protections in the law’s history, jeopardizing the waters our families and communities depend on. It is critical that the EPA is able to replace this disastrous law with protections that are grounded in science and protect public health and the environment. On February 5, the Senate approved the Capito amendment by a vote of 51-49 (Senate roll call vote 43). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Although it is a symbolic amendment, the Capito amendment was included in the final S. Con. Res. 5, which was approved by the House on February 5. ",Clean Water
Impeachment for Incitement of Insurrection,"The House delivered articles of impeachment to the Senate, H. Res. 24, impeaching President Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection. Trump encouraged and incited the deadly mob on January 6, and he perpetuated the unfounded and harmful claims about the 2020 election that inspired their actions. The riot caused multiple deaths and directly threatened our democratic process, and the president responded with inaction, followed by further defense of the violent behavior. Holding elected officials accountable and ensuring our elections remain free and fair are essential for the preservation of our democracy.

Granholm Confirmation (Energy Secretary),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Jennifer Granholm to serve as secretary of energy. The Department of Energy oversees the country’s energy, environmental and nuclear policy with a focus on transformative science and technology solutions. As Michigan governor, Granholm led policies that reduce pollution, accelerate clean energy, and promote environmental justice. Additionally, Granholm’s experience helping to rebuild the American auto industry during the last recession is invaluable as the Biden-Harris administration works to deliver a 100% clean energy economy. On February 25, the Senate confirmed Granholm to be secretary of energy by a vote of 64-35 (Senate roll call vote 66). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Other, Clean Energy"
Raimondo Confirmation (Commerce Secretary),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Gina M. Raimondo to serve as secretary of commerce. The secretary of commerce oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is well positioned to strengthen the agency’s mission, reestablish a culture of scientific integrity, and lead on ocean conservation. As the first female governor of Rhode Island, Raimondo committed Rhode Island to 100% renewable energy by 2030, and oversaw the development of the first offshore wind farm in the United States. Raimondo’s firsthand experience transitioning to a clean energy economy that creates good paying jobs at every skill level is a valuable asset to the Department of Commerce. On March 2, the Senate confirmed Raimondo to be secretary of commerce by a vote of 84-15 (Senate roll call vote 70). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Oceans"
Striking Provisions to Help Farmers of Color,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which would have stricken a provision to provide $5 billion in aid, largely in the form of debt relief to disadvantaged farmers of color, who have historically been marginalized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The combination of systemic racism and the federal government’s well-documented discriminatory policies and actions has led Black farmers to lose 90% of their farmland over the last century, and the number of Black farmers has dropped from 1 million to only 45,000 today. The COVID-19 pandemic only further exacerbated and highlighted the lack of support for farmers of color. The Toomey amendment undermined attempts to advance equity and begin addressing historic injustices farmers of color have experienced because of the USDA. On March 6, the Senate rejected the Toomey amendment by a vote of 49-50 (Senate roll call vote 86). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Environmental Justice, Agriculture"

As a member of Congress, Fudge built a strong record advocating for environmental justice and earned a lifetime 93% LCV score. Her leadership of HUD will be crucial in building healthier, more climate-resilient communities and promoting safe, affordable, and energy-efficient housing. Additionally, HUD will play a key role in building up resilience in urban communities and making renewable energy available to frontline communities.

Garland Confirmation (Attorney General),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to serve as attorney general. As the nation’s top law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice is responsible for safeguarding our civil and constitutional rights, including our right to live free from toxic air and polluted waters. Garland presided over several critical environmental cases as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by former President Obama in 2016. His even-handed and science-based approach will restore independence and integrity to the department, rebuild public trust in the rule of law, prioritize the robust enforcement of our environmental and civil rights laws, protect the fundamental right to vote, fight for environmental justice and seek the fair application of justice.

As a 12-term congressman, Becerra was an environmental champion, earning a lifetime LCV score of 91%. In his role as California state attorney general, he continually fought for equity and justice – for example, Becerra established an environmental justice branch for the California Department of Justice, championed protections for women, LGBTQ+ people, and people of color in healthcare, and sued the Trump administration over 60 times for their discriminatory and dangerous policies, including efforts to declare a national emergency as an excuse to build the environmentally damaging and xenophobic wall on the southern border. Our health and our environment are intrinsically linked, and Becerra’s outstanding leadership and experience helps to ensure the administration delivers on their goals to eliminate systemic racial injustice, including the disproportionate pollution burden borne by communities of color, and create a cleaner, healthier future for everyone.

Repealing Assault on Methane Pollution Safeguards,"Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sponsored S.J. Res. 14, the Congressional Review Act Resolution of Disapproval of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule to roll back the 2016 methane standards for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry is the largest source of industrial methane pollution, causing almost 25% of the climate change we currently experience. S.J. Res. 14 eliminates this dangerous rule and allows the EPA to move quickly on stronger safeguards against methane pollution, which will slow climate change and mitigate hazardous air pollutants that affect our communities, especially low-income communities and communities of color living on the frontlines of oil and gas drilling and processing. On April 28, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 14 by a vote of 52-42 (Senate roll call vote 175). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The president signed S.J. Res. 14 into law on June 30.

Investing in Water Infrastructure,"Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) sponsored S. 914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021 (DWWIA), which authorized increased funding for new and existing drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater programs to help provide clean water to communities across the country. Unfortunately, too many families still have to worry if the water coming from their taps is harming their families, and communities of color and low-wealth communities have disproportionately borne the brunt of water pollution and lack of investment in our water systems. S. 914 authorized funds for replacing lead service lines, reauthorized the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, started a pilot program at EPA for low-income water assistance, and authorized funding for rural and disadvantaged communities, among other measures. The legislation was an important step in ensuring everyone, no matter race, zip code, or economic status, has access to the clean water they need to thrive. On April 29, the Senate approved S. 914 by a vote of 89-2 (Senate roll call vote 178). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.

Jackson was previously appointed by President Obama to serve as a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which she did for eight years immediately preceding her elevation to the D.C. Circuit. President Obama also appointed her to serve as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission. During her time in that role, the commission took concrete action to reduce mass incarceration and ameliorate longstanding racist sentencing disparities related to the war on drugs. As a district judge, Jackson issued rulings in favor of disability rights, labor rights, immigrants’ rights, and a congressional subpoena related to the first impeachment investigation of President Trump.

Voting Rights and Democracy Reforms,"Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sponsored S. 2093, the For the People Act, a sweeping democracy reform bill that would address a range of threats to our democracy by expanding voting rights, strengthening ethics reforms, and reducing the influence of money in our elections. Everyone’s right to be heard and counted in the political process is essential to the function of our democracy and protection of our environment, and far too often people of color and frontline communities are targeted by restrictive voting laws and partisan gerrymandering. By ensuring that voters have access to the ballot box and their voices are not drowned out by outsized corporate interests, the people will be better equipped to hold politicians accountable and accomplish meaningful climate action.

Promoting Polluting Energy Sources,"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) offered an amendment to S. Con. Res. 14, the FY2022 budget resolution, which encourages deployment and use of coal and methane power plants with carbon capture and storage technology, and nuclear power plants. This amendment would protect these polluting industries from further oversight and is inspired by repeated failed attempts to further subsidize coal plants to keep them running under the false premise that coal retirements threaten grid reliability. When cold temperatures caused massive failures in fossil fuel generation and blackouts across Texas, it showed that propping up dirty fossil fuels will not prevent power outages or increase grid resiliency, and will increase the frequency of climate change-fueled extreme weather events. Rather, clean renewable energy paired with energy storage is the best way to improve resiliency and reduce unhealthy climate and air pollution, particularly in frontline communities. On August 11, the Senate approved the Hoeven amendment by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 346). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Although it is a symbolic amendment, the Hoeven amendment was included in the final S. Con. Res. 14, which was considered adopted in the House on August 24.","Dirty Energy, Climate Change, Air"
Build Back Better Budget Resolution,"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sponsored S. Con. Res. 14, the FY2022 budget resolution. Passage of the budget resolution set in motion the legislative procedure needed to pass President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take action to tackle the climate crisis in a way that addresses racial and economic inequality and creates millions of good jobs. The Build Back Better investments would set the U.S. on a path to cutting carbon pollution by at least half by 2030 and 100% carbon-free energy powering our electricity grid, new cars, buses, and buildings by 2035, while delivering at least 40% of benefits to communities of color and low-income communities that have borne the brunt of fossil fuel pollution.

In addition to restoring the protections of the 1965 law that was undermined by the Supreme Court in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and Shelby County v. Holder, S. 4 would update them to better address the modern forms of voter suppression seen in hundreds of anti-voter bills filed in state legislatures across the country in 2021. This legislation is a critical step toward ensuring that communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis across the country have their access to the ballot box protected.  This Senate version of the bill covers further ground than the House companion bill, by incorporating the proposed Native American Voting Rights Act, which would help native voters and tribal governments ensure equal access to the franchise despite unique obstacles these voters often face.

The deal threatens our climate and communities by continuing to support fossil fuel development, including dirty tar sands oil and fracked natural gas, and allowing oil and gas companies in Mexico to challenge environmental and climate regulations through the Investor-State Dispute Settlement system, all while failing to recommit the U.S. to the Paris Climate Agreement. Additionally, the deal fell far short on what is necessary to significantly strengthen enforcement mechanisms, protect against illegal flora and fauna trade, or address outsourcing and dumping of toxic pollution into air and water. Ultimately, the final agreement helps corporate polluters and wasted a critical opportunity to address the climate crisis and environmental issues created by international trade.

Inadequate Policing Reform,"Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) sponsored S. 3985, the JUSTICE Act, which would inadequately address the need for comprehensive policing reform. Black people have endured systemic racism and abusive policing practices for generations, but the mere incremental reforms and increased police funding of S. 3985 fail to address the priorities of racial justice organizations. Despite the outcry from racial justice organizations and activists following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake and many others, S. 3985 fails to address racial profiling, no-knock warrants, militarization equipment, or restrictions on use of force such as chokeholds. Environmental justice requires racial and social justice, and an effort to pass a legislative half-measure instead of meaningful change is unacceptable.

Inadequate COVID Relief Package,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attempted a vote on a bare-bones COVID-19 relief package instead of taking up a bill that met the needs of the country. In the midst of a raging pandemic that was causing disproportionate suffering in communities of color and Trump’s appointee as Postmaster General attempting to sway the upcoming election by delaying the delivery of mail-in ballots, the proposal would provide little funding for testing or public health response and merely provide loan forgiveness for the U.S. Postal Service and only if the agency got into even more dire financial straits. Unfortunately, it also would let companies off the hook for actions that endanger their employees, customers, and broader community. Among other failings, this inadequate bill would not have provided critical relief in the form of additional funding for state and local governments, vote-by-mail and election assistance to ensure smooth operation of our democracy, or a moratorium on utility disconnects at a time when it is even more essential for homes to have clean water for hand washing and heat and cooling, since community warming or cooling centers would defeat social distancing efforts. And it would provide unrelated and unnecessary support to extractive industries and coal companies. Environmental justice requires addressing the gross inequities and disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, and liability-erasing legislative half-measures are unacceptable.

Miller Confirmation (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Eric Miller to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the Ninth Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. In particular, the Ninth Circuit is critically important for environmental issues, covering nearly two-thirds of the nation’s public land and over half of all endangered species. LCV is committed to furthering racial justice and equity, and Miller has repeatedly challenged tribal rights, recognition and sovereignty, including through pro bono representation. We share the concerns of the National Council of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund, who strongly opposed Miller’s nomination and questioned his ability to rule fairly on cases involving tribal issues. Moreover, Miller’s record, including his writings and public statements, reflect a view of the legal system as a tool to protect corporations, rather than the public interest.

Wheeler’s inherent conflicts of interest, which stem from his long history of ties to the fossil fuel industry, and actions to undermine public health and environmental safeguards as deputy administrator of the EPA made him an entirely inappropriate choice for leading the agency. On February 28, the Senate confirmed Wheeler to be administrator of the EPA by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 33). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Clean Air, Clean Water"
Rao Confirmation (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Neomi Rao to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the D.C. Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Rao led efforts to roll back fundamental environmental protections and misuse the regulatory review process for partisan political purposes. Rao spent the past 20 years arguing against environmental and other public protections, disparaging efforts to keep our air and water clean as unnecessary burdens on corporate freedom, and even referring to the greenhouse effect as a “controversial theory.” Her long record on this issue, as well as her offensive and demeaning writings on sexual assault, race, and LGBTQ rights made it clear that she is incapable of serving fairly as a federal judge. On March 13, the Senate confirmed Rao to the D.C. Circuit by a vote of 53-46 (Senate roll call vote 44). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Justice and Democracy"
Wyrick Confirmation (District Court for Western District of Oklahoma),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Patrick Wyrick to be a U.S. District Court judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. It is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on our federal courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As Solicitor General for Oklahoma, Wyrick was former Oklahoma Attorney General and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s “dear friend and trusted counselor”—they worked together on multiple cases that challenged the EPA’s ability to protect public lands and clean air and address climate change. Wyrick’s record also raised serious ethical concerns. He made several inaccurate statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, including about his involvement in his wife’s business, his conflicts with oil and gas companies, and his false statements before the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 9, the Senate confirmed Wyrick to the Western District of Oklahoma by a vote of 53-47 (Senate roll call vote 68). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Justice and Democracy"
Bernhardt Confirmation (Interior Secretary),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of David Bernhardt to serve as the secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI). This position is critical to protecting our natural resources for future generations, but Bernhardt’s confirmation put our public lands and oceans, national parks and monuments, clean air and water, and wildlife at risk. With his long history of lobbying for the very industries under the Department of the Interior’s purview—creating numerous conflicts of interest—and his proximity to ethics scandals during his roles as acting Interior secretary and deputy secretary, it is clear Bernhardt has not put the public interest first. Bernhardt was the architect of some of the Trump administration’s most destructive natural resource policies, including overseeing the largest elimination of protected public lands and waters in U.S. history through President Trump’s unprecedented attempt to rescind two million acres of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, a radical expansion of offshore drilling, and the fast-tracking of efforts to drill in the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  On April 11, the Senate confirmed Bernhardt to be secretary of the Department of the Interior by a vote of 56-41 (Senate roll call vote 77). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Drilling, Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Other"
Jorjani Confirmation (Interior Solicitor),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Daniel Jorjani to serve as the solicitor  of the Department of the Interior (DOI). This position is the top lawyer for DOI, and is the bottom line on legal issues and ethics for the department. Before joining DOI, Jorjani held several positions with groups funded by the well-known oil magnates, the Koch brothers. Prior to his confirmation, Jorjani served as Interior’s Principal Deputy Solicitor and was responsible for providing legal guidance for some of the Interior Department’s most egregious decisions in support of Trump’s“energy dominance” agenda. Time and again his legal opinions  benefitted oil, gas, mining or extractive interests at the expense of conservation and public health. Jorjani has also demonstrated an aversion to transparency, including restricting Freedom of Information Act responses and justifying Interior Secretary Bernhardt’s troubling practice of not maintaining a calendar, which made it harder for the public to know with whom he has been meeting.  Jorjani’s ties to the fossil fuel industry and efforts to hinder transparency within the Department put him at odds with the core mission of the office of the solicitor. On September 24, the Senate confirmed Jorjani to be the solicitor of the Department of the Interior by a vote of 51-43 (Senate roll call vote 300). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Lands/Forests"
Scalia Confirmation (Labor Secretary),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Eugene Scalia to serve as the secretary of the Department of Labor (DOL). This position is critical to protecting labor rights and the safety of our workers as we transition to a clean energy economy, but Scalia’s confirmation puts workers and our communities at risk. He has a long history of working on behalf of corporate interests who have fought health and safety standards, including representing Big Oil’s fight against refinery safety regulations following catastrophic refinery fires across the nation. Efforts to transition to a clean energy economy require strong labor protections to keep workers safe, ensure greater equity and establish family-sustaining jobs. Scalia’s record starkly contrasts with these goals as well as the very mission of the Department of Labor.  On September 26, the Senate confirmed Scalia to be secretary of the Department of Labor by a vote of 53-44 (Senate roll call vote 313). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Stopping Rollbacks of Carbon Pollution Limits for Power Plants,"Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) sponsored S.J. Res. 53, the resolution of disapproval of the Trump administration EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy rule. In addition to demonstrating the broad opposition to the rule, if enacted, the resolution would invalidate the rule. Trump’s rule, more accurately titled the Dirty Power Scam, is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring science and favoring polluters over the public interest. This rule does nothing to fight climate change or protect communities from toxic pollution, and it lets fossil fuel-fired power plants off the hook to clean up their carbon pollution. The Dirty Power Scam would put no meaningful limits on carbon pollution, and, in fact, could lead to more pollution in many parts of the country than if there were no standard at all. On October 17, the Senate rejected S.J. Res. 53 by a vote of 41-53 (Senate roll call vote 324). YES IS THE PRO ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Undermining the Land and Water Conservation Fund,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to H.R. 3055, the Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2020, which would undermine the Land and Water Conservation Fund’s (LWCF) core conservation mission by jeopardizing the program’s ability to acquire lands for new or expanded LWCF sites. LWCF secures vital public access to green spaces; protects wildlife and other irreplaceable resources; help agencies reduce costs and address ongoing management issues (such as invasive species and wildfires); and enhances outdoor recreation opportunities. The rejection of this amendment is a victory for our nation’s best parks program and for all those who cherish our public lands. On October 31, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 29-64. NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Lands/Forests
Border Wall Funding & Anti-Immigrant Policy,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) offered an amendment to H.R. 2579, which would have funded the environmentally destructive and xenophobic border wall and advanced anti-immigrant policies. The border wall threatens communities living along our southern border, has far ranging negative impacts on our lands, wildlife and waterways, and circumvents bedrock environmental laws. This amendment would spend nearly $25 billion on an ineffective and damaging border wall and military technology, and would waive 36 environmental and cultural laws for construction of the wall and other border enforcement activities on federal lands within 100 miles of both the northern and southern borders. The Grassley amendment also includes policies that would cause significant harm to immigrant families, including gutting family immigration and eliminating the diversity visa lottery program. On February 15, the Senate rejected the Grassley amendment by a vote of 39-60 (Senate roll call vote 36). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other

Exposing Waterways to Invasive Species,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) offered S. 1129, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act, as an amendment to S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. This amendment included the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA), which would leave our waters more vulnerable to aquatic invasive species by exempting the shipping industry from requirements under the Clean Water Act in favor of a new, weaker regulatory scheme. By shifting the EPA’s authority to regulate ballast water to the Coast Guard, VIDA would set a dangerous precedent for transferring authority to agencies that are ill-equipped to handle the responsibility. In addition, VIDA would pre-empt the states’ capacity to enact and enforce their own ballast water rules, undermining their ability to protect their waterways from pollution and invasive species. Lastly, VIDA would exempt ships in geographically restricted areas -- such as the Great Lakes -- from any regulation, further jeopardizing some of our most iconic water bodies. On April 18, the Senate rejected the McConnell amendment by a vote of 56-42 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 77). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Wildlife, Clean Water"
Bridenstine Confirmation (NASA Administrator),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Representative Jim Bridenstine for administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Bridenstine’s extreme views of NASA’s mission, his voting record, his many scientifically inaccurate statements, and his lack of qualifications make him an unacceptable choice for NASA administrator. His voting record is at odds with NASA’s mission and shows a history of opposition to science-based environmental standards and support for weakening agencies’ use of science in decision-making. As recently as 2016, Bridenstine sought to change the mission of NASA by authoring legislation that essentially stripped out Earth Science and Earth Observing Missions. Scientists, researchers, and individuals across the country rely on this data and the continuity of its collection to understand, forecast, and respond to changes in land use, pollutant emissions, atmospheric chemistry, weather and climate, and other phenomena. On April 19, the Senate confirmed Bridenstine to be administrator of NASA by a vote of 50-49 (Senate roll call vote 80). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Pompeo Confirmation (Secretary of State),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Representative Mike Pompeo to serve as secretary of state. The secretary of state is tasked with carrying out the president’s foreign policy agenda and plays a key role in shaping international climate policy. Pompeo has deep ties to the Koch Brothers and has consistently favored polluting fossil fuel interests. During his time in Congress, Pompeo voted against protecting public health, conserving imperiled species, and advancing renewable energy, earning an abysmal 4 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. Pompeo’s anti-environmental record, climate science denial, preference for war over diplomacy, and hostility to human rights should be disqualifying. On April 26, the Senate confirmed Pompeo to be secretary of state by a vote of 57-42 (Senate roll call vote 84). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Other"
Anti-Environmental Rescission Package,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sponsored H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act, also known as the rescission package, which would have cut funding for several programs that protect our environment and public health. H.R. 3 would slash programs that promote needed investments in clean energy and conservation, as well as $16 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Additionally, this package, which the Trump administration proposed, irresponsibly rescinds funding levels agreed upon by Congress, and much of the funding that H.R. 3 would cut has been identified for future use and could continue to support projects and communities across the country. On June 20, the Senate rejected a motion to discharge H.R. 3 by a vote of 48-50 (Senate roll call vote 134). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Oldham Confirmation (Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Andrew Oldham to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Fifth Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As deputy solicitor general for the State of Texas and general counsel to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Oldham frequently challenged federal environmental protections and efforts to address climate change. In his personal capacity, Oldham has questioned the constitutionality of the EPA, calling it “illegitimate.” He has also taken strong stances against immigrant rights and voting rights, supporting challenges to the Voting Rights Act and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Oldham’s partisan and anti-environment record are disqualifying for a judicial nominee. On July 18, the Senate confirmed Oldham to the Fifth Circuit by a vote of 50-49 (Senate roll call vote 160). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Judiciary
Grant Confirmation (Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Britt Grant to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Eleventh Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As solicitor general for the state of Georgia, Grant repeatedly fought to weaken the Endangered Species Act, one of our nation’s most successful conservation programs. She has also sought to weaken the Voting Rights Act, and opposed LGBTQ equality and immigrant rights. Grant’s partisan and anti-environment record are disqualifying for a judicial nominee.

Justices on the court have an impact lasting generations, and it is essential that they respect precedent, interpret the law in a fair and wellreasoned manner, and act as an independent check on the president. Kavanaugh’s record reflects a concerning preference for corporations and polluters over public health and the environment. In repeated rulings he has shown hostility towards the Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to strike down fundamental protections of our air and water. In addition to his environmental record, the credible sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh are disqualifying for a nominee to the Supreme Court. On October 5, the Senate invoked cloture on Kavanaugh’s nomination by a vote of 51-49 (Senate roll call vote 222). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Judiciary

The mission of the ENRD is to enforce the nation’s environmental laws to ensure clean air, water and land for all people in this country. Clark is an outspoken opponent of environmental and public health protections, and a well-known climate change denier. He has spent his career undermining the protections ENRD is tasked with enforcing, making him unfit to lead the division.

Nelson Confirmation (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Ryan Nelson to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Ninth Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit, the largest circuit court covering nearly three-quarters of the United States’ public lands, serves a crucial role in deciding some of our nation’s most important environmental cases. During his time in the Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD), Nelson oversaw the legal defense of the President George W. Bush administration’s efforts to benefit polluters and roll back critical environmental protections. This included helping the government argue against regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in Massachusetts v. EPA. On July 31, the Senate confirmed Nelson to the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 51-44 (Senate roll call vote 232). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Judiciary
McNamee Confirmation (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Bernard McNamee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). An independent agency that oversees transactions in the U.S. wholesale power market, FERC has historically been a non-partisan entity that is committed to ensuring just and reasonable energy rates. However, in McNamee’s previous role at the Department of Energy, he took steps to bailout the coal industry and weaken renewable energy’s growing foothold in the U.S. power sector. As an outspoken climate doubter and renewable energy critic, it is clear McNamee is unable to be a non-partisan, unbiased FERC commissioner. On December 6, the Senate confirmed McNamee to FERC by a vote of 50-49 (Senate roll call vote 254). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Clean Air"
Farm Bill Conference Report,"Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and led negotiations on the 2018 Farm Bill, officially titled H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. These negotiations resulted in a bipartisan conference report, which was essentially free of environmentally harmful provisions. The conference committee removed a number of anti-environmental attacks that were in the House-passed Farm Bill, including language that would have jeopardized our clean water, cut money from critical conservation programs, eviscerated protections for endangered species, and undercut our bedrock environmental laws. Instead, the final Farm Bill conference report provided new tools to conserve and restore our land, water, and forests, including maintaining funding for conservation programs, new incentives to help farmers improve water quality and soil health, support for clean energy and energy efficiency for small businesses and farmers, expanded opportunities for outdoor recreation, and new funding to encourage growth of the organic sector. On December 11, the Senate passed the Farm Bill conference report 87-13 (Senate roll call vote 259). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.

Extreme Assault on the Stream Protection Rule (CRA),"Representative Bill Johnson (R-OH) sponsored H.J. Res. 38, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” of the Stream Protection Rule, which would threaten the drinking water and public health of communities living near coal mining operations by permanently blocking the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Stream Protection Rule. This important rule set commonsense requirements for coal mining to better protect ground water, surface water, and ecosystems from toxic coal mining waste, which has been linked to increased rates of cancer, birth defects, and other health problems in nearby communities. The rule protects 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, set up new requirements for water quality monitoring and restoration, and generally compels coal mining companies to reduce their impact on the surrounding environment. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit DOI from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future. Following its passage in the House, on February 2, the Senate approved H.J. Res. 38 by a vote of 54-45 (Senate roll call vote 43). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Trump signed H.J.

This rule helped bring transparency to the flow of money between fossil fuel companies on the U.S. stock exchanges and U.S. and foreign governments, deterring corruption and mismanagement among all parties. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit the SEC from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future. Following its passage in the House, on February 3, the Senate approved H.J. Res. 41 by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 51). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Trump signed H.J.

The attorney general is responsible for defending and enforcing laws that ensure justice, safety, health and wellness for all people in this country. Sessions has publicly denied the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is real and caused by human activity, and he has repeatedly questioned the need for safeguards from the Environmental Protection Agency, earning a 6 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. In 1986, the Senate rejected Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship over concerns about prejudice and overt racism, and he has supported strict voter ID laws that restrict access to the ballot. Sessions’ record made it clear that he would not be an arbiter of justice and truth for all people and would not defend the laws that protect people’s health.

Therefore, OMB has influence over environmental and public health safeguards, as well as funding levels for environmental priorities. Mulvaney denies the scientific consensus on climate change and repeatedly voted against environmental safeguards as a congressman, earning a 7 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. Mulvaney has also rejected the scientific consensus on other issues, such as the link between the Zika virus and birth defects, and he has questioned the need for government funded scientific research.

Pruitt Confirmation (EPA Administrator),"The Senate considered President Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA and its leader are charged with protecting human health and the environment – our air, water, and land. In his role as the Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times, attempting to block efforts to cut carbon pollution and weaken safeguards for our air and water. Pruitt has repeatedly denied the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity and has extremely close ties to fossil fuel interests. During his confirmation process, Pruitt refused repeated requests to turn over email correspondence between his Oklahoma attorney general’s office and oil and gas companies. By ignoring sound science and showing no interest in upholding our nation’s bedrock environmental and public health laws, Pruitt failed to meet the most basic standards needed to perform this job in good faith.

This position is critical to protecting our treasured natural heritage for future generations, but Zinke puts our public lands, national monuments and parks, clean air and water, and wildlife at risk. Zinke’s record on protecting America’s majestic public lands has far too often failed to meet his pro-conservation rhetoric, resulting in a 4 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. Zinke has refused to accept the reality of climate science and consistently put the interests of corporate polluters ahead of our air, water, lands, and wildlife.

Blocking Local Input about Public Lands (CRA),"Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) sponsored H.J. Res 44, the Congressional Review Act ""Resolution of Disapproval"" of the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) “Planning 2.0” Rule. The “Planning 2.0” Rule allows BLM – which is responsible for managing more than 245 million acres of public lands – to approach the management of public lands in a more holistic way that considers conservation and outdoor recreation needs by increasing the participation of local stakeholders and engaging them earlier in the planning process. Repealing this rule would result in BLM reverting back to an outdated land management planning process that has not been updated for over three decades. Additionally, this use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit BLM from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future.

Blocking Wildlife Protections in Alaska (CRA),"Representative Don Young (R-AK) sponsored H.J. Res 69, the Congressional Review Act ""Resolution of Disapproval"" of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) Alaska National Wildlife Refuges Rule. This rule protects wildlife from the intensive predator control policy designed by the state of Alaska, which aims to significantly suppress the populations of native carnivores in order to artificially inflate game populations. The state’s predator control policy is not based on sound science and permits extreme and inhumane practices. These practices include killing wolves and bears in their dens, bear baiting, and using airplanes to scout and hunt bears. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit FWS from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" protections in the future.

Justices on the Supreme Court have an immense responsibility to protect the rights of the people in this country and to interpret the constitution without personal ideological influence. In the coming decade, the Supreme Court will tackle critical issues relating to voting rights and the environment, both of which will have lasting impacts for generations to come. Gorsuch’s record reflects support for corporations at the expense of the public interest. His stance on the “Chevron doctrine” and demonstrated hostility towards the regulatory power of federal agencies could undermine the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to enforce safeguards against polluters. On April 7, the Senate approved Gorsuch’s confirmation by a vote of 54-45 (Senate roll call vote 111). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Extreme Assault on the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule (CRA),"Representative Rob Bishop (R-UT) sponsored H.J. Res. 36, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” of the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule, which would block efforts to reduce dangerous methane pollution released by the oil and gas industry on our public and tribal lands. The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Methane Rule established commonsense standards that require oil and gas companies to deploy readily available, cost-effective measures to reduce methane lost through venting, flaring, and leaks. The rule helps to decrease the over $300 million in natural gas that is wasted each year from our public and tribal lands and to provide up to $800 million in royalty revenues to states, tribes, and federal taxpayers over the next decade. Additionally, the Methane Rule reduces the methane pollution that contributes to climate change as well as hazardous air pollutants that damage the health of local communities by contributing to increased asthma attacks and other respiratory ailments. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit BLM from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future.

Bernhardt’s long history of lobbying for many of the industries—including oil and gas, mining, and developers—under DOI's regulatory purview creates numerous conflicts of interest. Additionally, Bernhardt’s career is marked by many instances of fighting against federal environmental safeguards, and he has been in close proximity to ethics scandals during his previous tenure at DOI. Finally, during his confirmation hearing, Bernhardt would not commit to leading the agency to tackle the urgent challenge of climate change and the dangers it poses to our natural resources. On July 24, the Senate confirmed Bernhardt to be deputy secretary of the Interior by a vote of 53-43 (Senate roll call vote 166). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Other"
Undermining Federal Safeguards for Protected Species,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to H.Con.Res. 71, the Budget Resolution, which called for legislation to undermine the protection of plants and wildlife listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Lee amendment would strip federal safeguards for protected species found entirely within the borders of a single state, including all listed plants and animals in Hawaii. The fate of about 77 percent of all federally protected species would thus depend on state laws and funding, but states generally lack the programs and resources necessary to recover listed species and ultimately prevent their declines and extinctions. On October 19, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 49-51 (Senate roll call vote 242). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ",Wildlife
Protecting the Arctic Refuge,"Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) sponsored an amendment to H.Con.Res. 71, the Budget Resolution. This amendment would remove the budget reconciliation instructions that paved the way for drilling in the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The indigenous Gwich’in people call the Arctic Refuge’s coastal plain “the sacred place where life begins,” reflecting the importance and the need to protect this special place. These reconciliation instructions for Arctic drilling were included in the Budget Resolution as an attempt to generate $1 billion in government revenue to somehow justify $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy, but multiple analyses show that it is unlikely to raise anywhere close to even that amount. On October 19, the Senate rejected the Cantwell amendment by a vote of 48-52 (Senate roll call vote 243). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The budget resolution, including the Arctic Refuge drilling instructions was adopted on October 26.","Lands/Forests, Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Budget Resolution Paving the Way for Drilling in the Arctic Refuge,"Representative Diane Black (R-TN) sponsored H.Con.Res. 71, the Budget Resolution, which authorized an increase in the deficit of $1.5 trillion to enact the GOP tax bill and will likely result in cuts to safeguards for our air, water, lands and wildlife. The legislation paved the way for the tax bill to include a rider that turns the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge into an industrial oil field.  On October 19, the Senate approved H.Con.Res. 71 by a vote of 51-49 (Senate roll call vote 245). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House passed the Senate version of the budget on October 26 and the resolution was adopted.","Lands/Forests, Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Eid Confirmation (10th Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Allison Eid to the Tenth Circuit U.S Court of Appeals. Lower court judges have an immense responsibility to protect the rights of the people of this country and to interpret the constitution without personal ideological influence. It is the lower court judges who often serve as the final arbiter of justice. Unfortunately, Eid has a disturbing history of siding with corporate polluters over the environment and public health. She has written academic pieces that applaud the outcome of the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. US Army Corps of Engineers decision, which created confusion over the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. In Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission v. Grand Valley Citizens’ Alliance, Eid sided with oil companies, allowing them to bypass public hearings and local input before obtaining drilling permits. On November 2, the Senate confirmed Eid to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals by a vote of 56-41 (Senate roll call vote 259). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
"Wehrum Confirmation (Assistant Administrator, EPA)","The Senate considered President Trump's nomination of William Wehrum to serve as assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR). This important office at the EPA plays a key role in protecting people from air pollution and radiation exposure, making this position critical to maintaining and enforcing public health safeguards. But Wehrum’s long history of representing many of the industries—utilities, energy companies, and other major polluters—that are attempting to roll back safeguards issued under the Clean Air Act, make him unfit to serve in this position. Additionally, during his previous tenure at the OAR from 2001 to 2007, Wehrum led efforts to weaken safeguards to reduce mercury emissions from coal fired power plants and other safeguards intended to reduce lead, fine particulate pollution, and ozone smog pollution. On November 9, the Senate confirmed Wehrum to be assistant administrator of OAR by a vote of 49-47 (Senate roll call vote 268). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Climate Change, Clean Air, Other"
Anti-Environmental Tax Bill that Opens Drilling in the Arctic Refuge,"Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX) sponsored H.R. 1, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which sells out key environmental priorities to deliver a massive tax cut for millionaires, billionaires, and huge corporations. The bill increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion, harming people nationwide by likely resulting in cuts to safeguards for our air, water, lands and wildlife. The legislation puts our clean energy future at risk while maintaining giveaways to fossil fuel interests. The conference report for H.R. 1 even turns the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge into an industrial oil field. Following its passage in the House, on December 20, the Senate approved the conference report for H.R. 1 by a vote of 51-48 (Senate roll call vote 323). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Trump signed H.R. 1 into law on December 22.","Lands/Forests, Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Extreme Attack on Clean Water Protections (CRA),"Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored S.J. Res. 22, a Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval,” which would void the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule that protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of 117 million people in this country. Not only would this radical legislative tool vacate the current rule, it would also prohibit the agencies from developing any “substantially similar” rule in the future, keeping the unworkable status quo in place. This could prevent the agencies from ever issuing rules that establish Clean Water Act protections for the waters covered by the Clean Water Rule, leaving our streams, wetlands, lakes, and rivers vulnerable to pollution for generations to come. On January 19, President Obama vetoed S.J. Res. 22. On January 21, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to the S.J. Res. 22 veto override by a vote of 52-40 (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 5). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Water
Clean Energy Funding,"Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would increase funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, an important Department of Energy research program intended to spur transformational breakthroughs in energy technologies. Additional funding for this program could help the United States lead in the clean energy transformation. On January 28, the Senate approved the Schatz amendment by a vote of 55-37 (Senate roll call vote 9). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. S. 2012 passed the Senate and moved to conference with a House-passed energy bill, but did not become law.",Clean Energy
National Monuments,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would gut the Antiquities Act, the law first used to protect half of our national parks. The Antiquities Act has been used by 16 presidents of both parties to protect many of America’s most special places, from the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon to the Pacific Remote Islands in Hawaii. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 47-48 (Senate roll call vote 10). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Lands/Forests
Energy Efficiency,"Senator Al Franken (D-MN) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would establish a national energy efficiency resource standard based on successful programs in Minnesota that require electricity and natural gas providers to meet annual targets for cutting energy use in homes and businesses. Energy efficiency saves consumers money while reducing the public health and environmental risks of pollution. This amendment would also send a clear market signal that would spur research and development of energy efficient technologies. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Franken amendment by a vote of 43-52 (Senate roll call vote 11). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Clean Energy
Fast Tracking Natural Gas Pipelines,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would set strict, arbitrary deadlines for the review of natural gas pipelines on federal and tribal lands. This amendment undermines the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by promoting accelerated construction of pipelines and other components of natural gas production at the cost of the environmental reviews that NEPA established to identify serious safety and environmental risks. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Barrasso amendment by a vote of 52-43 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 12). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"
Limiting Public Safeguards,"Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would require federal agencies to eliminate a public protection with equal or greater compliance costs before adopting a new one. The Sullivan amendment adopts an extreme and unwise “cut-go” approach to rulemaking, drastically limiting the government’s ability to quickly respond to emerging public health threats and catastrophes like the drinking water crisis that unfolded in Flint, Michigan. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Sullivan amendment by a vote of 49-46 (Senate roll call vote 13). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Taxpayer Handouts for Fossil Fuel Companies,"Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would phase out fossil fuel subsidies for coal and some of the largest producers of oil and gas over a four-year period, the same time period over which Congress recently decided to phase out tax credits for solar and wind. The fossil fuel subsidies phased out by this amendment represent billions of dollars of taxpayer handouts for a mature and highly-polluting industry. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Schatz amendment by a vote of 45-50 (Senate roll call vote 14). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Dirty Energy
Genetically Modified Food Labeling,"Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) introduced S. 2609, a bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, also known as the Denying Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act, which would prevent states from requiring the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In addition, the bill would make it harder for companies to inform customers about their ingredients, strip the Food and Drug Administration of its jurisdiction over GMO food disclosures, and force the USDA to spend resources promoting biotechnology to consumers. The majority of people in the United States increasingly want to know more about where their food comes from, not less. But instead, this bill’s sweeping preemption of state and local authority is an attack on consumer choice and state efforts to protect human health and the environment. Senator Roberts’ bill was added to S. 764, but on March 16, the Senate rejected the DARK Act by a vote of 48-49 (Senate roll call vote 37). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. S. 764 was later amended and passed by both chambers and signed into law by President Obama on July 29.",Toxics/Public Right to Know
Encouraging Energy-Efficient Homes,"Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would reform the mortgage market to incentivize energy efficiency by ensuring that energy costs are included in the underwriting process. More efficient homes save money for homeowners while reducing carbon pollution. On April 19, the Senate approved the Isakson amendment by a vote of 66-31 (Senate roll call vote 49). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. S. 2012 passed the Senate and moved to conference with a House-passed energy bill, but did not become law.",Clean Energy
Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF),"Senator James Lankford (R-OK) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would divert money away from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) in order to address maintenance projects in our national parks. This amendment would restrict spending from LWCF’s statutorily-directed purpose in order to address the National Park Service’s deferred maintenance backlog. On April 19, the Senate rejected the Lankford amendment by a vote of 34-63 (Senate roll call vote 50). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Lands/Forests
Wind Energy Transmission Line,"Senator John Boozman (R-AR) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would require additional studies before proceeding with the construction of a 700-mile electricity transmission project that would bring wind energy from the Great Plains to the southeast. The project, known as the Plains and Eastern Clean Line project, would provide much-needed transmission capacity to our outdated grid and has already been approved under a process created by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. On April 19, the Senate rejected the Boozman amendment by a vote of 42-55 (Senate roll call vote 51). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Clean Energy
Victory Bonds for Clean Energy,"Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would require the secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan to issue Clean Energy Victory Bonds. These bonds would aim to raise as much as $50 billion and would be used to finance clean energy projects, including wind, solar, advanced vehicles, and fuel cells. Rapid deployment of clean energy technology is the best way to fight climate change. On April 19, the Senate rejected the Udall amendment by a vote of 50-47 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 52). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Clean Energy
Attack on the Clean Water Rule,"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) offered an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which would prohibit the use of funds for implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule, which protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of 117 million people in the United States.

Water Conservation Program,"Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) offered an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which would create a pilot program for water conservation in the Colorado River system. With climate change fueling droughts across the western United States, a new approach to water use in the Colorado basin is badly needed. On April 26, the Senate approved the Reid amendment by a vote of 73-23 (Senate roll call vote 62). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. H.R. 2028 was signed into law by President Obama on December 10.","Water, Climate Change"
Mitigating Impacts on Fish and Wildlife,"Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) offered an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which would require the Secretary of the Army to use federal and state expertise to mitigate the fish and wildlife impacts of the Army Corps of Engineers’ projects. This amendment clarifies requirements in the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 to ensure that federal agencies give full consideration to wildlife impact analyses from the Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies. On May 11, the Senate rejected the Cardin amendment by a vote of 39-60 (Senate roll call vote 69). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Wildlife
Revenue Sharing for Offshore Drilling,"Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) sponsored S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016, which would expand revenue sharing from offshore drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, which creates incentives for additional offshore drilling that damages our climate and coastal communities, businesses, and ecosystems. Offshore drilling inevitably leads to oil spills, which puts at risk coastal communities’ robust tourism and commercial and recreational fishing industries, as well as critically important wildlife, while impeding America’s transition to clean energy. Revenue sharing also siphons revenues away from the Treasury and directs them to a handful of states at a time when we are struggling to address our nation’s fiscal challenges. On November 17, the Senate rejected a motion to end debate and proceed to S. 3110 by a vote of 51-47 (60 votes were needed to end debate; Senate roll call vote 153). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Oceans"
Limiting Access to the Courts,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would have a chilling effect on citizen enforcement of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), one of American’s most effective and important environmental laws that serves as a safety net for wildlife, fish and plants on the brink of extinction. By subjecting ESA lawsuits to the Equal Access to Justice Act’s below-market cap on legal fees, this amendment would make it more difficult for citizens from across the political spectrum to obtain counsel and challenge illegal government actions. On January 21, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 54-45 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 7). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Attack on Clean Air Protections,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would exempt power plant units that burn ""coal refuse"" or waste from complying with certain clean air and public health protections required under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Cross State Air Pollution Rule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Communities living downwind from these plants would suffer negative health consequences, ranging from asthma attacks to premature deaths, were these clean air exemptions to become law.

Climate Change Science,"Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which expresses the sense of Congress that climate change is real and that man-made pollution is a significant contributor to climate change. 2014 and 2015 were the two hottest years on record, and this amendment references the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other scientific institutions. On January 21, the Senate rejected the Schatz amendment by a vote of 50-49 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 12). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL VOTE.",Climate Change
Prioritizing Drilling on Public Lands,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would expedite the applications to drill on America’s public lands and would limit the amount of public input in the decision-making process. Oil and gas companies now have more access to America’s public lands than they currently use and it makes no sense to limit public engagement.

Forcing Tar Sands Polluters to Pay for Spills,"Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would close a tax code loophole that exempts tar sands producers from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Without this fix, taxpayers are on the hook to pay for tar sands spill clean-ups like the ongoing $1.2 billion effort in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

International Climate Action,"Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which undermines the United States’ ability to encourage other countries to address climate change and would be a significant setback in the global fight against climate change. The Blunt amendment seeks to undermine the November 2014 U.S.-China announcement that demonstrated both countries’ commitment to tackling this challenge and builds momentum toward a global solution to the climate crisis.

Prairie-Chicken Protections,"Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would delist the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The Moran amendment subverts the science-based process the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses to determine the population viability of various species and removes protections deemed necessary for the prairie chicken’s survival. On January 28, the Senate rejected the Moran amendment by a vote of 54-44 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 35). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Wildlife
National Monuments,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would express the sense of Congress that national monument designations on federal lands should require approval by the governor and state legislature. Although non-binding, this amendment undermines the intent of the Antiquities Act of 1906, a law that 16 presidents of both parties have used to move swiftly in the face of threats and protect some of America’s most treasured places like the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty.

Keystone XL would lead to a significant expansion of tar sands development, unleashing massive amounts of carbon pollution and threatening surrounding communities, ecosystems, and watersheds including the Ogallala aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions of Americans. Despite these threats, Keystone XL would create just 35 permanent jobs and would not enhance American energy independence.

The Cotton amendment would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to examine the “cumulative” economic effects of a critical habitat designation, such as the effect on agriculture and business. The FWS already evaluates the total federal costs of a critical habitat designation and this amendment would drain agency resources that could be better used to further protections for wildlife and plants.

Fast Track of Trade Agreements,"Representative Patrick Meehan (R-PA) sponsored H.R. 1314, the Trade Act of 2015, which approves “fast track” trade promotion authority for international trade agreements. Fast track allows the administration to send already-signed international trade deals to Congress for an up or down vote with limited debate and no amendments, severely hampering Congress’ ability to ensure these agreements benefit communities and protect our environment. Given the scope of these massive agreements and their implications on environmental policies and protections around the world, Congress and the American public have a right to know what is in these deals before negotiations are finished. However, the fast track process established in H.R. 1314 severely lacks both accountability and transparency and does not result in the “race to the top” that is necessary to make real, enforceable progress on environmental and public health issues in these agreements. On May 22, the Senate passed H.R.1314 by a vote of 62-37 (Senate roll call vote 193). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed fast track authority into law on June 29.",Other
Climate Change Science Education,"Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) offered an amendment to S. 1177, the Every Child Achieves Act of 2015, which would establish a K-12 climate change education grant program. Participating states would compete for grants in order to create climate change science and solutions curriculum, teacher trainings, and to achieve sustainable building standards. On July 15, the Senate rejected the Markey amendment by a vote of 44-53 (Senate roll call vote 238). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Gutting Clean Water Protections,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) sponsored S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, a radical assault on the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule, which protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of one in three Americans. S. 1140 would block implementation of the current Clean Water Rule and would require the agencies to re-propose another rule, forcing them to go back to the drawing board, repeating processes and soliciting input that they have already received, a waste of time and taxpayer money. In addition, this bill would also severely narrow and undermine the Clean Water Act itself by arbitrarily defining which waterways deserve protection without any basis in science or recognition of the important role of headwaters and seasonal and rain-dependent waters on downstream water quality. On November 3, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to S. 1140 by a vote of 57-41 (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 295). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Water
Extreme Assault on Clean Water Rule (CRA),"Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored S.J. Res. 22, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval,” which would void the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule that protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of 117 million Americans. Not only would this obscure and radical measure vacate the current rule, it would also prohibit the agencies from developing any “substantially similar” rule in the future, keeping the unworkable status quo in place leaving our streams, wetlands, lakes, and rivers vulnerable to pollution for generations to come. On November 4, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 22 by a vote of 53-44 (Senate roll call vote 297). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama vetoed S.J. Res. 22 on January 20, 2016.",Water
Extreme Attack on Carbon Pollution Limits for Existing Power Plants (CRA),"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored S.J. Res. 24, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” that would permanently block the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan established the first national limits on carbon pollution from existing power plants—our nation's single largest source of the pollution fueling climate change. S.J. Res. 24 is an extreme measure that would block the biggest step our country has ever taken to address climate change, threatening our health and our future. S.J. Res. 24 would also prohibit the EPA from ever developing “substantially similar” standards in the future. On November 17, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 24 by a vote of 52-46 (Senate roll call vote 306). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Following its passage in the House, President Obama vetoed S.J. Res. 24 on December 18.",Climate Change
Extreme Attack on Carbon Pollution Limits for New Power Plants (CRA),"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) sponsored S.J. Res. 23, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” that would block the Environmental Protection Agency’s carbon pollution standards for new and modified power plants. S.J. Res. 23 is an extreme measure would permanently block these clean air protections, putting our health at risk and slowing our country's transition to an economy powered by clean energy. On November 17, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 23 by a vote of 52-46 (Senate roll call vote 307). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Following its passage in the House, President Obama vetoed S.J.

Undermining Flood Insurance Reform,"Representative Michael Grimm (R-NY) sponsored H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which would repeal and delay key provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. Artificially discounted flood insurance rates have led to the development and destruction of floodplains. By undermining steps to increase flood insurance premiums to market-based levels, H.R. 3370 would encourage further floodplain development and lead to the destruction of wetlands, forests, and other habitats that help mitigate flood damage, which will only be made worse by climate change. On March 13, the Senate passed H.R. 3370 by a vote of 72-22 (Senate roll call vote 78). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed H.R. 3370 into law on March 21.",Climate Change
Clean Energy Tax Credits,"Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) offered a substitute amendment to H.R. 3474, the Hire More Heroes Act of 2014, which would extend dozens of tax incentives, including vital clean energy tax credits. The package of tax extenders, known collectively as the Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency (EXPIRE) Act, would extend several energy efficiency incentives and the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which is particularly critical to the continued growth of wind energy. Clean energy tax credits like the PTC have a proven track record of increasing investment, decreasing costs, creating jobs, and reducing pollution. On May 15, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to the EXPIRE Act by a vote of 53-40 (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 157).YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed a shorter-term tax extenders package that included the PTC into law on December 19; however, this only extended tax credits through the end of 2014.",Clean Energy
Environmental Review in Transportation Rebuilding,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) offered an amendment to H.R. 5021, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014, which would exempt the post-disaster rebuilding of transportation infrastructure that was closed for safety reasons from any environmental reviews, approvals, licensing, or permitting. In doing so, the amendment would threaten the environment and public health and roll back bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act, even though these laws already provide flexibility and waivers for emergency situations. On July 29, the Senate rejected the Toomey amendment by a vote of 47-50 (Senate roll call vote 247). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Air, Water"
Democracy for All Constitutional Amendment,"Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) sponsored S.J. Res. 19, an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relating to contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections. This resolution would be a historic step toward reducing the influence of big corporations and other special interest polluters in our elections and restoring the voice of the American people. While amendments to the Constitution are of serious consequence and should not be taken lightly, the dramatic increase of money in politics since the disastrous Citizens United U.S. Supreme Court decision has allowed special interests to spend unlimited amounts of money to protect their ability to pollute our air and water. On September 11, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to S.J. Res. 19 by a vote of 54-42. (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 261). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline (KXL),"Senators John Hoeven (R-ND) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA) sponsored S. 2280, a bill to automatically approve the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, which would transport the world’s dirtiest oil through the American heartland to an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast where it would be exported. Keystone XL would lead to a significant expansion of tar sands development, unleashing massive amounts of carbon pollution and threatening surrounding communities, ecosystems, and watersheds including the Ogallala aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions of Americans. Despite these threats, Keystone XL would create just 35 permanent jobs and would not enhance American energy independence. S.2280 would short circuit the federal approval process, eliminating the State Department’s ability to assess whether the pipeline is in the national interest and the President’s authority to ultimately approve or reject the project. On November 18, the Senate rejected S. 2280 by a vote of 59-41 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 280). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy"
Disaster Relief for Hurricane Sandy,"Following its passage in the House, the Senate took up H.R. 152, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, which would provide much needed support for communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy. H.R. 152 included funding to repair national parks and historical treasures as well as many provisions to assess the vulnerability of coastal communities to future disasters and to encourage better pre-disaster planning in a changing climate. On January 28, the Senate approved H.R. 152 by a vote of 62-36 (Senate roll call vote 4). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed H.R. 152 into law on January 29.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Climate Change, Other"
Military Investments in Advanced Biofuels,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 933, the Department of Defense (DOD), Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, which would strip $60 million in funding for advanced biofuels from the DOD budget. The amendment sought to reassign funding for advanced drop-in biofuel production to cover other military operations and expenses.  The DOD is the single largest energy user in the nation, and investing in these renewable fuels significantly reduces pollution and the military’s carbon footprint.  Advanced biofuels also enhance American energy security by giving the military more fuel options and loosening its dependence on foreign oil. On March 20, the Senate rejected the Toomey amendment by a vote of 40-59 (Senate roll call vote 41). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Clean Energy, Dirty Energy"
Big Oil Budget,"Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which was intended to force a vote on House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) alternative House budget resolution. The Ryan budget would make drastic cuts that would jeopardize the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department, Energy Department and other agencies to fulfill their mission to protect our health, safeguard our natural resources, and grow clean energy. While slashing investments that protect our air, water, and open spaces, the Ryan budget would continue billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil industry and lower Big Oil’s tax bill even further by reducing corporate income tax rates. It would also support construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, which would transfer the world’s dirtiest and most carbon-polluting oil through the American heartland to be exported at an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast. On March 21, the Senate rejected the Ryan budget by a vote of 40-59 (Senate roll call vote 46). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ",Other
Pricing Carbon Pollution,"Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which would prevent Congress from enacting legislation that would place a federal tax or fee on carbon emissions. This amendment would limit Congress’s ability to address climate change, which poses a severe threat to our economy, health, and environment, and would rule out a promising source of revenue for the government. On March 22, the Senate rejected—by a vote of 53-46—a procedural motion that would allow a vote on the Blunt amendment (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 59). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline (KXL),"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) sponsored a non-binding Sense of the Senate amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which would support the approval and construction of the harmful Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. The Keystone XL pipeline would transfer the world’s dirtiest and most carbon-polluting oil through the American heartland to be exported at an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast. The pipeline would threaten our waterways and agricultural lands with oil spills and dramatically worsen climate change, while doing nothing to increase America’s energy security. On March 22, the Senate approved the Hoeven amendment by a vote of 62-37 (Senate roll call vote 61). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The non-binding amendment went no further and a final decision is expected from President Obama in 2014.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy, Water"
Toxic Air Pollution from Power Plants,"Senator Dan Coats (R-IN) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which sought to weaken the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by making it easier for power plants to win an exemption from the requirements. When implemented, these clean air safeguards will save tens of thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks. While the Coats amendment purports to simply ensure that power plants have the necessary time to meet the standards, it would undermine public health protections. The EPA and the states already have the authority to grant additional time for power plants to install pollution control equipment and the EPA has made clear that more time is also available in order to maintain electric grid reliability. On March 22, the Senate rejected the Coats amendment by a vote of 46-53 (Senate roll call vote 72). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Air
Climate Change Safeguards,"Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which would enact indiscriminate funding cuts that would prevent federal agencies from curbing greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. As health experts and scientists have extensively documented, carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases threaten public health by causing more heat waves and intense smog, spreading infectious diseases, and bringing about stronger storms, floods, and hurricanes. On March 22, the Senate rejected the Inhofe amendment by a vote of 47-52 (Senate roll call vote 76). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Jewell Confirmation (DOI),"After she was nominated by President Barack Obama, the Senate considered the nomination of Sally Jewell to serve as Secretary of the Interior. As the former CEO of the outdoor recreation retail company REI, Jewell has a unique appreciation for public lands and conservation, and knows firsthand how important it is to protect lands that Americans enjoy for recreational activities like hiking, hunting, fishing, and camping. Throughout her career, Jewell has displayed the ability to skillfully manage a large and successful organization while also working to strengthen Americans’ connection to the outdoors. During her confirmation hearing, she further laid out her vision for a balanced and responsible approach to managing our public lands. On April 10, the Senate approved Jewell’s nomination by a vote of 87-11 (Senate roll call vote 94). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
National Endowment for the Oceans,"Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) sponsored an amendment to S. 601, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, which would establish a National Endowment for the Oceans (NEO) to improve ocean health and support coastal economies. Following the recommendations of the bi-partisan U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy appointed by President George W. Bush, the NEO would support efforts to conserve and restore ocean resources through grants to states, regional and tribal entities, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions. It would also help ensure the sustainable management of our oceans through increased research, monitoring, and observation data. On May 8, the Senate approved the Whitehouse amendment by a vote of 67-32 (roll call vote 116). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. As of this writing, the Whitehouse amendment is under consideration as part of the Water Resources Development Act conference committee. ",Oceans
Clean Water Protections,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) offered an amendment to S. 601, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, which would threaten waters Americans depend on for drinking, swimming, and fishing. The amendment would bar the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from restoring longstanding Clean Water Act protections to critical streams and wetlands across the nation. It would prohibit the Army Corps and EPA from limiting pollution in waterways that supply public drinking water for 117 million Americans and block efforts to protect wetlands that are critical for flood protection. On May 14, the Senate rejected the Barrasso amendment by a vote of 52-44 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 119). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Water
Advancing Conservation in the Farm Bill,"Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) sponsored S. 954, the Senate Farm Bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013, which would enact important conservation practices to protect soil, wetlands, and wildlife. The bill included a historic agreement between agriculture organizations and environmental groups on conservation compliance, requiring farmers to comply with basic soil and water conservation measures in order to receive taxpayer-funded premium subsidies for crop insurance. It also included a national Sodsaver provision that would protect native wildlife habitat and clean water supplies by discouraging farmers from converting America's prairies and grasslands into cropland. On June 10, the Senate approved S. 954 by a vote of 66-27 (Senate roll call vote 145). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. As of this writing, the House and Senate Farm Bills are in conference committee.","Water, Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
Border Fence,"Senator John Thune (R-SD) offered an amendment to S. 744, the Senate Immigration Bill titled the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which would unnecessarily mandate the construction of hundreds of additional miles of destructive double layered walls along the Southwest border. Additional border walls would lead to more damaging floods by impeding the natural flow of water, and would further fragment habitat, jeopardizing imperiled species like jaguars, ocelots, and big horn sheep. Moreover, reports by the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office have failed to find any evidence that the existing border wall has made a significant contribution to border security. On June 18, the Senate rejected the Thune amendment by a vote of 39-54 (Senate roll call vote 151). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
McCarthy Confirmation (EPA),"After holding up her confirmation vote for over 100 days and Senate Republicans flooding her with over 1,000 questions, the Senate considered President Barack Obama’s nomination of Gina McCarthy to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). McCarthy is extremely well qualified to lead the EPA, and has been widely praised as a proven problem solver who has worked with members of both political parties, industry leaders, and environmental advocates to develop a balanced, sensible approach to protecting public health and the environment. She has worked for both Republicans and Democrats, serving under five Republican governors, including Governor Mitt Romney as his energy and climate adviser in Massachusetts. Since 2009, McCarthy has led the Clean Air division of the EPA, where she has made extraordinary progress protecting our air quality. On July 18, the Senate approved McCarthy’s nomination by a vote of 59-40 (Senate roll call vote 180). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Air, Water"
Offshore Drilling,"Senator David Vitter (R-LA) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would put virtually every U.S. coastline at risk by expanding offshore drilling with no consideration of environmental impacts. The amendment would cut the public out of the review process and reinstate President Bush's 2010-2015 five year leasing plan, which even Bush administration officials said lacked important environmental safeguards and required additional vetting. This drilling expansion could harm billion-dollar coastal industries and undermine military activities in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia and would fail to accomplish the amendment's purported goal of raising significant revenue for roads and bridges. It would also fail to reduce the price at the pump since oil prices are set on a global market. On March 8, the Senate rejected the Vitter amendment by a vote of 43-55 (Senate roll call vote 28). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Drilling, Dirty Energy"
Toxic Pollution from Industrial Boilers,"Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would roll back Environmental Protection Agency safeguards to reduce toxic air pollution, such as mercury, lead, and particulates, from industrial boilers and incinerators. The amendment would gut the Clean Air Act and lead to tens of thousands of premature deaths, over 17,000 heart attacks, and more than 180,000 asthma attacks. Toxic pollution from industrial boilers is also known to cause developmental problems in children. On March 8, the Senate rejected the Collins amendment by a vote of 52-46 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 30). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Air
Gulf Coast Restoration & Land and Water Conservation Fund,"Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would amount to the largest increase in funding for restoration and conservation in a generation. The amendment included the RESTORE Act, legislation ensuring that penalties paid by BP and others responsible for the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill are used to rebuild and restore Gulf Coast communities and habitats. It would also fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at a record level of $700 million a year for two years. On March 8, the Senate approved the Nelson amendment by a vote of 76-22 (Senate roll call vote 32). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The RESTORE Act was included-while unfortunately the LWCF funding provision was not-in the compromise transportation bill (H.R. 4348, MAP-21), which President Obama signed into law on July 6.","Lands/Forests, Oceans, Water"
Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline (KXL),"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would lead to the construction of the dangerous Keystone XL tar sands pipeline-a project to transport the world's dirtiest and most carbon-polluting oil 2,000 miles from the boreal forests of Canada across America's heartland to an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast in order to export it. The amendment irresponsibly asserted that no additional safety or environmental analysis of the pipeline was necessary to ensure the protection of Americans' land, air, water, and health, despite Obama administration findings to the contrary, and the fact that no route for the pipeline existed. On March 8, the Senate rejected the Hoeven amendment by a vote of 56-42 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 34). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy, Water"
Arctic Refuge & Offshore Drilling & KXL,"Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee Ranking Member Pat Roberts (R-KS) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would threaten communities on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts with new offshore drilling, allow oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, open millions of acres of public lands to oil shale and tar sands leasing, and authorize the immediate construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline despite significant safety and environmental concerns. In addition to causing immense environmental damage, the oil and gas leasing required by the amendment would fail to achieve its purported goal of raising the revenues necessary to fund the new transportation infrastructure included in the bill. On March 13, the Senate rejected the Roberts amendment by a vote of 41-57 (Senate roll call vote 38). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy, Drilling, Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
Clean Energy Tax Incentives,"Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would extend critical incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency aimed at creating clean energy jobs and reducing America's dependence on foreign oil. The amendment would extend several incentives that are particularly important to the wind industry, including the Production and Investment Tax Credits, the Section 1603 Treasury Department Program, and the Section 48C Manufacturing Tax Credit. It would further extend the efficient existing and new homes tax credit and the efficient appliances tax credit. Although the package also included some incentives for harmful fuels, including coal-to-liquids that threaten the environment and exacerbate global warming, it was, on balance, an important step forward for the nation's clean energy economy. On March 13, the Senate rejected the Stabenow amendment by a vote of 49-49 (Senate roll call vote 39). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Many of the energy incentives included in the Stabenow amendment were extended until the end of 2013 as part of H.R. 8, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, legislation to address the ""fiscal cliff,"" which President Obama signed into law on January 2, 2013.",Clean Energy

Oil Subsidies & Clean Energy Incentives,"Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) sponsored S. 2204, the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act, which would close tax loopholes for the nation's largest oil companies and direct the savings toward investments in clean energy, energy efficiency, and deficit reduction. Massive oil companies reported profits of nearly $1 trillion during the past decade and $90 billion in just the first nine months of 2012 alone, so they have no need for taxpayer handouts. Ending these wasteful subsidies would also stop the practice of subsidizing a dangerous product that is fueling climate change and polluting our air, water, and land. Using some of these savings, the bill would extend for an additional year tax incentives for electric vehicles, cellulosic biofuels, energy-efficient homes and appliances, and numerous forms of clean energy. The remaining savings from repealing Big Oil's subsidies - nearly $11 billion - would be put towards reducing the deficit. Although it would also support harmful fuels like coal-to-liquids, S. 2204 would, on balance, represent a critical move away from dirty fossil fuels in favor of cleaner forms of energy. On March 29, the Senate rejected a motion to curtail debate and pass S. 2204 by a vote of 51-47 (60 votes were needed for the motion to pass; Senate roll call vote 63). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Clean Energy"
Genetically Engineered Salmon,"Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) offered an amendment to S. 3187, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which would ensure that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a definitive decision-making role in the process for approving genetically engineered marine and anadromous fish, including genetically engineered farmed salmon. As a food safety agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) simply does not have the requisite experience or staff expertise to fully evaluate the potential environmental and economic risks that could result from the approval of genetically engineered fish. NOAA, the federal agency charged with protecting the nation's oceans and its vital fisheries, is better suited to properly assess these issues, and giving NOAA a clear role in the approval process is sound and commonsense policy. On May 24, the Senate rejected the Murkowski amendment by a vote of 46-50 (Senate roll call vote 106). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. On July 9, President Obama signed S. 3187 into law, which unfortunately did not include the Murkowski amendment.","Wildlife, Oceans, Other"
Toxic Air Pollution from Power Plants,"Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Ranking Member James Inhofe (R-OK) sponsored S.J. Res. 37, a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval, which would void the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard for power plants, thus threatening the lives and health of thousands of Americans. Mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard is a long overdue public health safeguard that, for the first time, sets national limits on harmful air toxins that are emitted from oil- and coal-burning power plants, including mercury, acid gases, lead, and arsenic. Power plants are the single largest U.S. source of mercury pollution, which is especially dangerous to children and expectant mothers. Once fully implemented in 2016, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths, thousands of heart attacks, and over 100,000 asthma attacks each year. The CRA resolution is a radical legislative tool that would undo these protections and prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from ever taking similar steps in the future to protect communities from this harmful power plant pollution. On June 20, the Senate rejected the Inhofe CRA resolution by a vote of 46-53 (Senate roll call vote 139). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Air
Conservation on Private Farmlands,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S. 3240, the Senate farm bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, which would repeal the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Conservation Reserve Program. Together, these two programs reward agricultural producers who help conserve critical natural resources on more than 75 million acres of farm and ranch land in the United States. These programs not only are very popular with farmers, but also have a proven track record of providing valuable taxpayer benefits by improving soil, water, and wildlife habitat. On June 20, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 15-84 (Senate roll call vote 148). NO IS THE PROENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Conservation Compliance,"Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) offered an amendment to S. 3240, the Senate Farm Bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, which would reattach basic soil and water conservation measures to premium subsidies for crop insurance, restoring longstanding requirements that those who receive subsidies take some minimal steps to protect the public good. The amendment would save an estimated $60 million, ensure all farmers have a level playing field with regard to eligibility requirements for subsidies, and help ensure long-term farm productivity by protecting vital natural resources. It would also ensure that taxpayer funds do not subsidize damaging soil erosion that chokes our waterways, increases the cost of water treatment and dredging, and reduces the long-term productivity of farmland. Without the Chambliss amendment, this Farm Bill would allow for the destruction of tens of thousands of acres of valuable wetlands, resulting in increased downstream flooding, loss of wildlife habitat, and decreased water quality. On June 20, the Senate approved the Chambliss amendment by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 155). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law a broader legislative package averting the year-end ""fiscal cliff"" that included an extension of the 2008 Farm Bill through September 30, 2013; however, the Chambliss amendment was not part of the extension.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Industrial Farm Clean Water Violations,"Senator Mike Johanns (R-NE) offered an amendment to S. 3240, the Senate Farm Bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from efficiently and effectively monitoring for Clean Water Act violations at industrial-scale livestock operations via aircraft. This tool is primarily used to observe large animal feeding operations, where manure spills into water bodies are easily identifiable from the air. These flyover inspections are conducted in small planes and have been done for nearly a decade as a cost-effective alternative to on-site inspections, and Congress does not restrict how the EPA monitors any other industries. The EPA has a responsibility under the law to monitor for this kind of pollution and should not be prohibited from doing so through a reliable means that saves significant taxpayer dollars.

Military Investments in Alternative Fuels,"Senator Mark Udall (D-CO) offered an amendment to S. 3254, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which would restore the military's ability to invest in alternative fuels. Shifting from fossil fuels to alternatives like advanced biofuels reduces the military's carbon footprint and reduces pollution, while giving the military more fuel options and loosening its dependence on foreign oil. Investing in advanced biofuels could also enhance national and economic security by keeping military energy spending down and reducing exposure to oil price shocks. On November 28, the Senate approved the Udall amendment by a vote of 62-37 (Senate roll call vote 206). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.

Sweeping Environmental Funding and Policy Assault,"H.R. 1, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011, which at the time it passed the House was the greatest legislative assault ever on the environment and public health, including massive funding cuts and policy assaults on our air, water, wildlife and wild places. On February 19, the House passed H.R. 1 (House roll call vote 147).  On March 9, the Senate rejected H.R. 1 by a vote of 44-56 (Senate roll call vote 36).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The Obama administration and Senate leadership subsequently stood strong in negotiations with the House and insisted that most--but not all--of the anti-environmental riders from H.R. 1 be dropped before agreeing to the final compromise bill, H.R. 1473, which the president signed into law on April 15.","Air, Clean Energy, Climate Change, Water, Wildlife"
Global Warming Pollution,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) offered an amendment to S. 493, small business reauthorization legislation officially titled the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, to repeal the scientific finding by the EPA that greenhouse gases endanger human health and the environment, to permanently block the EPA from reducing greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and to undermine fuel economy standards.  This radical amendment would jeopardize public health and the environment, and increase our dangerous dependence on oil.  On April 6, the Senate rejected three other anti-environmental amendments--sponsored by Senators Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Max Baucus (D-MT)--to weaken or delay the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act and then proceeded to reject the McConnell amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 54).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  On April 7, the House passed H.R. 910, which is identical to the McConnell amendment (House roll call vote 249).  At the end of 2011, the EPA's ability to reduce greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act remained firmly intact.",Climate Change
Oil Subsidies,"Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) sponsored S. 940, the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, which would close tax loopholes for oil companies, since their outsized profits make it clear that they do not need taxpayer handouts. At a time when our fiscal situation is prompting cuts to critical programs, including environmental and clean energy investments, our government should not be subsidizing massive oil companies that reported profits of nearly $1 trillion during the past decade. On May 17, the Senate failed to achieve the 60-vote threshold needed to pass a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 940. The motion failed on a 52-48 vote (Senate roll call vote 72).

Offshore Drilling,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) introduced S. 953, the deceptively titled Offshore Production and Safety Act of 2011, which would expand offshore drilling and make it more dangerous by enacting oversight standards that are weaker than those in place before the catastrophic 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which tragically killed eleven workers, wreaked havoc on Gulf coast businesses in the fishing and tourism industries, and damaged coastal and marine ecosystems.  The bill would mandate numerous lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off Virginia's beaches, requiring the government to use outdated and inadequate environmental reviews in the processing of new leases, even though the reviews do not consider the impacts of a worst-case scenario like the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The bill would also impose a rushed and arbitrary time period of just 30 days for the Interior Secretary to approve or deny drilling permits, and it would grant automatic approval if no action is taken within 60 days.  On May 18, the Senate rejected a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 953 by a vote of 42-57 (Senate roll call vote 73).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Regulatory Rollbacks,"Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) offered this amendment to S. 782, the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011, which would have severely undermined the regulatory process.  This amendment would create several unnecessary new processes to complicate economic analyses of proposed rules and to ensure interagency consultation that is already conducted by the Office of Management and Budget.  It would also require a lengthy periodic review process for rules at select agencies, including the EPA, and impose mandatory budget cuts if reviews are not conducted or are incomplete.  Furthermore, this biased review process would look at rules' costs but not their benefits--including the environmental, health, food safety and other important benefits--which numerous third party analyses have found far outweigh their costs.  On June 9, the Senate--in a 53-46 vote--failed to achieve the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Snowe amendment (Senate roll call vote 87).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The House passed several bills that would severely undermine the regulatory process and jeopardize vital public protections (House roll call votes 880, 888, and 901); however, no such proposals have made it to the President's desk.",Other

Conventional corn ethanol has far-reaching negative environmental impacts, including water pollution, global warming pollution, and habitat destruction, and is already mandated by the Renewable Fuel Standard. On June 16, the Senate adopted the Feinstein-Coburn amendment by a vote of 73-27 (Senate roll call vote 90). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The ethanol tax subsidy and import tariff expired at the end of 2011 and were not renewed by Congress.",Dirty Energy
Gutting Transportation Enhancements,"Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) offered this amendment to H.R. 2112, the FY12 Appropriations bill for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, to defund the Transportation Enhancements program.  This proven program has been the largest source of federal funding for trails, walking, and biking for 20 years, and amounts to less than 2% of overall spending on surface transportation.  Transportation currently accounts for more than two-thirds of our nation's annual oil use and roughly one-third of our global warming emissions, and this small program is critical for giving people access to cleaner transportation choices.  On November 1, the Senate rejected the Paul amendment 38-60 (Senate roll call vote 190).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Transportation
Broad Environmental Assault (S.1786),"Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch (R-UT) sponsored S. 1786, the Long-Term Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, which is a sweeping and extreme assault on our government's ability to protect the public from a wide range of threats, ranging from pollution to workplace safety.  While framed as a transportation bill, this legislation actually includes S. 299, the REINS Act--a radical assault on our system of public protections--as well as a host of provisions undermining specific bedrock public health and environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.  The bill would stop the EPA from cleaning up harmful pollution such as mercury, soot, smog, arsenic, lead, and carbon dioxide from some of our nation's biggest polluters, including power plants, cement plants, and industrial boilers and incinerators.  On November 2, the Senate rejected a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 1786 by a vote of 47-53 (Senate roll call vote 196).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The House has passed numerous pieces of legislation that are part of S. 1786, including H.R. 10--the House version of the REINS Act--on December 7 (House roll call vote 901).","Air, Climate Change, Other"
Cross-State Air Pollution,"Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) sponsored S.J. Res. 27, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to void the Cross-State Air Pollution rule, which will save lives and improve public health for millions of Americans. The Cross-State rule, which was finalized in July 2011, reduces dangerous smog and soot-forming pollution that is emitted from power plants and travels across state lines, and is estimated to save up to 34,000 lives and to prevent 400,000 asthma attacks, 15,000 heart attacks, and 1.8 million missed days at school or work each year, among other health benefits. On November 10, the Senate rejected S.J. Res 27 by a vote of 41-56 (Senate roll call vote 201). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House had previously passed legislation on September 23 to block the Cross-State rule as part of the TRAIN Act (House roll call vote 741). There were no further legislative attempts to block the Cross-State rule in 2011, but the D.C. Circuit Court temporarily stayed the Cross-State rule on December 30.",Air
Broad Environmental Assault (S. 1720),"Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member John McCain (R-AZ) sponsored S. 1720, the so-called Jobs Through Growth Act, an extreme assault on our government's ability to protect the environment and public health.  While framed as a jobs bill, this legislation would prevent the EPA from cleaning up harmful pollution from some of the nation's biggest polluters, reduce oversight for drilling, open our precious public lands to harmful tar sands development by private companies, and prohibit California from ensuring that enough water is allocated to protect salmon and Delta smelt.  On November 10, the Senate rejected S. 1720 by a vote of 40-56 (Senate roll call vote 202).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Air, Dirty Energy, Drilling, Water, Wildlife"
Undermining Critical Environmental Programs,"Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced S.J. Res. 10, legislation to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget every year, and to limit spending to 18% of U.S. gross domestic product.  This legislation's draconian spending cap would undercut the federal government's abilities to meet its core commitments, including protecting our air, water, wildlife, and lands.  Independent economic analysts projected catastrophic consequences if a balanced budget amendment were already in place for FY12.  On December 14, the Senate rejected this resolution by a vote of 47-53 (Senate roll call vote 229).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The House voted on a series of balanced budget amendments; however, no such proposals made it to the President's desk.",Other
Border Fence Construction,"Nearly one-third of the 1,950 mile United States-Mexico border lies within military, tribal, and public lands, including wilderness areas, national wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests, national monuments, and state parks. Much of this country's most magnificent and imperiled wildlife -- including jaguars, ocelot, bighorn sheep, Sonoran pronghorn, and hundreds of bird species -- depend upon these public lands for intact habitat.

Lead Paint Protections,"Exposure to lead is linked to a range of human health impacts, from behavioral problems and learning disabilities to seizures and death. Children under the age of six are most at risk. To improve public health, the EPA now requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in pre-1978 homes, child care facilities, and schools be certified to do so by the EPA. They also must use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices.

These subsidies dwarf the incentives that are currently available for renewable energy and energy efficiency and distort the market in favor of this mature industry that is a major source of global warming and other toxic pollutants. President Obama called for the elimination of many of these subsidies in his budgets for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 and agreed to eliminate these subsidies in a pledge made with other world leaders at a Group of 20 Summit in 2009. Congress, however, has not taken the steps necessary to end these subsidies.","Drilling, Clean Energy, Dirty Energy"
Biodiesel Tax Credit,"A tax credit for biodiesel was created in 2004 as part of the JOBS Act, which provided $1.00 to the fuel blenders for each gallon of biodiesel blended into petroleum diesel. The credit expired at the end of 2009. Since the creation of this tax credit, the environmental benefit of biodiesel has been called into question as expanded soybean and other biodiesel feedstock production has contributed to the destruction of natural ecosystems and increased agricultural inputs. The credit is considered a driver of biodiesel production in the United States, resulting in environmental damage worldwide. For example, biodiesel produced from soybeans in the United States results in a significant amount of land use change internationally, and expanded soybean production is a primary factor in the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"

Clean energy and energy efficiency received significant support in the economic recovery package of 2009, which boosted these critical industries at a time of economic crisis. Unfortunately, the 111th Congress failed to enact additional policies that would further unleash the job-creation potential of these industries, either in the form of a comprehensive clean energy and global warming bill or a federal Renewable Electricity Standard. However, as the Congress drew to a close, senators were presented with a unique opportunity to invest in these industries.",Clean Energy

Offshore Drilling,"Like most of America's coasts, Florida's Gulf of Mexico coastline has been protected by the 25-year bipartisan congressional moratorium on new offshore oil and gas drilling. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush instituted a separate set of protections on new coastal drilling near the Florida Keys, which President Bill Clinton extended through 2012 for most of Florida's Gulf Coast.","Drilling, Dirty Energy"
Arctic Wildlife Refuge,"The protection of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is among the highest priorities for the national environmental community. Nowhere else on our continent is the complete range of arctic and sub-arctic landscapes protected in one unbroken chain, and no other conservation area in the circumpolar north has such abundant and diverse wildlife, including rare musk oxen, polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, millions of migratory birds, and more than 120,000 caribou. The refuge's 1.5 million-acre coastal plain has been called ""America's Serengeti.""","Drilling, Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Dirty Energy"
Population,"By allowing women to plan the size of their families, voluntary family planning programs also help to conserve natural resources in areas where expanding human numbers threaten biodiversity and endangered species. Since the mid-1990s, family planning opponents have cut U.S. funding for these programs by arguing, in part, that the money funds abortion. In fact, the use of U.S. foreign assistance to fund abortion has been prohibited since 1973.",Other
Stormwater Cleanup,"Polluted stormwater runoff can contain heavy metals, oil and gas, and huge volumes of sediment. For that reason, roads, highways, parking lots, and other paved surfaces are the largest source of water pollution in coastal areas today, according to EPA.",Water
Environmental Funding Cuts,"Robust funding for environment and natural resources stewardship is critical to keeping air and water clean, protecting public lands, and safeguarding fish and wildlife. Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2006 budgets proposed by the Bush Administration and endorsed by congressional leaders made substantial cuts to environmental programs.",Other
Brown Nomination,The Bush Administration has continued to nominate and re-nominate federal judges who are hostile to basic environmental safeguards. That pattern continued with the nomination of California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.,Other
Renewable Energy,"One of the quickest and easiest ways to deploy more renewable energy is to create a market-based national standard that requires electric utilities to generate more electricity from renewable energy sources. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, similar requirements in 24 states and the District of Columbia have produced enough electricity to power 20 million U.S. homes and have reduced as much carbon dioxide as taking 11.5 million cars off the road or planting 18.6 million acres of trees.",Clean Energy
Natural Gas Facilities,"Gas companies are seeking to increase the number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on U.S. coasts. These facilities can pose substantial risks, however, for human health and the environment. For that reason, state and local governments have sometimes intervened in the debates over where these facilities are sited.",Dirty Energy
Global Warming,"Over the past century, the Earth's surface temperature has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit. The primary cause of global warming is increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to raise sea levels, trigger extended heat waves, exacerbate hurricane seasons, and destroy habitat and species. As a result, environmentalists overwhelmingly support mandatory limits on global warming pollution from power plants, factories, vehicles, and other sources.",Climate Change
Fuel Economy,America's cars and light trucks consume 8 million barrels of oil every day--more than 40 percent of total U.S. oil consumption. Raising the miles-per-gallon standard of these vehicles is the biggest single step the U.S. could take to cut both oil dependence and global warming emissions.,"Clean Energy, Transportation"

Human Pesticide Testing,"Chemical companies seeking pesticide approvals from EPA have submitted data from dozens of experiments in which humans were intentionally dosed with these toxic chemicals. Many physicians, ethicists, and environmentalists, as well as many citizens, believe the testing of pesticides on humans is unethical and unscientific. EPA has twice imposed a moratorium on considering such tests, once under President Clinton and again under the current President Bush. But after litigation and other skirmishes, EPA in 2005 reversed its position.",Toxics/Public Right to Know
Tongass Logging Roads,"At 17 million acres, the Tongass National Forest of southeast Alaska is the world's largest remaining old-growth temperate rainforest. Centuries-old trees provide critical habitat for wolves, grizzly bears, wild salmon, and bald eagles.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
