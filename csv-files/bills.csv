Bill,Summary,Issues
Changing Filibuster Rules to Pass Democracy Reforms,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) filed a procedural motion to allow H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, to pass the Senate with a simple majority rather than the 60-vote supermajority normally needed to overcome a filibuster. The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would be the most significant pro-democracy legislation in the U.S. in half a century. It would restore and modernize the full protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the Supreme Court undermined in Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, and it would update them to better address the modern forms of voter suppression seen in hundreds of anti-voter bills filed in state legislatures across the country during the last two years. This legislation would also protect free and fair elections by safeguarding and expanding voter access, banning partisan gerrymandering, modernizing voter registration, strengthening our campaign finance system, protecting election integrity, and promoting security of election systems. Everyone’s right to be heard and counted in the political process is essential to the functioning of our democracy and protection of our environment, and far too often it is people of color and frontline communities who are targeted by restrictive voting laws and gerrymandering–the same communities most impacted by climate change and environmental injustice. Ensuring that voters have access to the ballot box and their voices are not drowned out by outsized corporate interests would better equip the people to hold politicians accountable and safeguard meaningful public health and environmental protections. On January 19, the Senate upheld the ruling of the chair, sustaining the filibuster and blocking the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, by a vote of 52-48 (Senate roll call vote 10). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Thomas Confirmation (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Joe Biden’s nomination of Holly A. Thomas to serve as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is one of the nation’s most powerful courts, with jurisdiction over more land and more people than any other court except the United States Supreme Court. Federal judges serve for life and the laws that protect our environment and democracy are only as strong as the judges who uphold and enforce them. Before becoming a judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Thomas litigated in prestigious governmental and nonprofit positions to advance fair employment and housing, LGBTQ+ rights, and school desegregation, among other important causes. As a Black woman and as a career public-interest lawyer, Thomas brings personal and professional diversity to a judiciary that has long been dominated by White male judges appointed after careers in private law firms or as prosecutors. On January 20, the Senate confirmed Thomas to be a Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 48-40 (Senate roll call vote 11). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Jackson Confirmation (Supreme Court),"The Senate considered President Joe Biden’s nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court exercises extraordinary authority over all levels of government and areas of public policy, including climate, clean water, democracy, and civil rights. Like all federal judges, Supreme Court justices serve for life, and environmental laws are only as strong as the judges who uphold them. Jackson was previously appointed by President Biden to serve as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and by President Barack Obama to serve both as a district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and as the vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission. During her time at the Sentencing Commission, it took concrete action to reduce mass incarceration and ameliorate longstanding racist sentencing disparities related to the war on drugs. As a district judge, Jackson issued rulings in favor of disability rights, labor rights, immigrants’ rights, and a congressional subpoena related to the first impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump. Jackson is the first Black woman and first former public defender ever to serve on the Supreme Court, and the first Supreme Court nominee in decades to have been confirmed by the Senate on three prior occasions. On April 7, the Senate confirmed Jackson to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States by a vote of 53-47 (Senate roll call vote 134). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Expanding Dirty and Dangerous Offshore Drilling,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) sponsored a motion to instruct (MTI) Senate conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, to force the Biden-Harris administration to immediately develop a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan that includes a minimum of 10 region-wide oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. This damaging MTI not only contradicts the necessity to act on climate change and protect coastal communities and wildlife, but it also circumvents the careful, participatory statutory process used to develop the five-year plan. The oil and gas industry has already stockpiled millions of acres of unused leases, and new leases that are sold would not start producing for years or decades, thus having no impact on current oil prices. On May 4, the Senate approved the Barrasso MTI by a vote of 53-44 (Senate roll call vote 148). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Portions of the underlying bill, though none mandating completion of a five-year plan or a minimum of lease sales, were included in the final  Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) & Science Act (H.R. 4346) that the president signed into law on August 9.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Oceans"
Undermining International Climate Commitments,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) sponsored a motion to instruct (MTI) Senate conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, to eliminate international-focused provisions included in the House-passed America Creating Opportunities for Manufacturing Pre-Eminence in Technology and Economic Strength (COMPETES) Act of 2021, including an $8 billion authorization for the Green Climate Fund, the establishment of a State Department program to provide adaptation, mitigation, and security assistance to under-resourced countries, a professed commitment to implementing the Paris climate agreement and addressing climate change, and the establishment of a State Department task force to coordinate a whole-of-government response to climate change. As the wealthiest nation in the world and one of the largest historical emitters of climate pollution, the U.S. has an obligation to swiftly advance our own clean energy transition through all the tools at our disposal, and to contribute our fair share to support under-resourced countries in meeting our shared climate goals – all of which this amendment would undermine. On May 4, the Senate rejected the Lee MTI by a vote of 48-49 (House Roll Call 150). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. While this MTI was rejected, the crucial climate provisions it sought to eliminate were not ultimately included in the  Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) & Science Act (H.R. 4346), the final version of this bill which the president signed into law on August 9. ",Climate
Hampering Presidential Emergency Actions on Climate,"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored a motion to instruct (MTI) to Senate conferees on H.R. 4521, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA) of 2021, which would undermine the president’s authority to declare a national, major disaster, or public health emergency, or to invoke the authorities of the Defense Production Act because of climate change. At a moment where we do find ourselves in a climate emergency, we must be able to use all the available tools to tackle this crisis, including these important presidential emergency powers. On May 4 the Senate agreed to Senator Capito’s MTI by a vote of 49-47 (House roll call vote 157). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. While agreed to here, these attacks on presidential emergency powers were not included in the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) & Science Act (H.R. 4346), the final version of this bill which the president signed into law on August 9.","Climate, Clean Energy"
Restoring the Right to Abortion Access,"Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) sponsored S. 4132, the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022, to prohibit governmental restrictions on providing and accessing abortion services. For nearly 50 years, the U.S. Constitution protected the right to abortion. The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the venerable precedent of Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in the nation’s history, removed a constitutional right. The people most impacted by the loss of this fundamental right are the same people who bear the greatest burdens from the climate crisis, environmental injustice, and voter suppression: communities of color, communities with low wealth, and rural communities. This legislation would create a statutory right to abortion access, restoring federal protections against state-level abortion bans. Additionally, near majority support for this bill in the Senate highlights the extreme decisions of the current Supreme Court majority, that has also undermined protections for the environment, democracy, and racial justice. On May 11, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 4132 by a vote of 49-51 (Senate roll call vote 170). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Undercutting Public Input and Environmental Review,"Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) sponsored S.J. Res 55, a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) that would undermine core provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act’s (NEPA) implementation, namely regulations that were restored by President Joe Biden. In 2020, the Trump administration severely rolled back long-standing NEPA regulations, seeking to entrench federal climate denial, hastily permit dangerous or polluting projects, and systematically disenfranchise low-income, rural, and communities of color from government decision making. The Biden-Harris administration’s rule restored basic elements of the Council on Environmental Quality’s NEPA regulations, including consideration of climate change and cumulative impacts of projects on communities, because they are critically important to addressing the climate crisis and environmental justice. On August 4, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 55 by a vote of 50-47 (Senate roll call vote 283). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House did not take action on this resolution in 2022.","Environmental Justice, Climate Change; Other"
Elimination of Superfund Tax,"Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that would strike the Superfund tax included in the bill and replace it with a one-year extension of the 2019 State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction limitation. Reinstating the Superfund tax on polluters, which previously expired in 1995, will help the Environmental Protection Agency better fund and accelerate the cleanup of Superfund sites across the country. Superfund sites are primarily former industrial sites awaiting remediation that are the most heavily contaminated and likely to threaten public health and are disproportionately located near communities of color and communities with low wealth. Since the modest Superfund tax on polluters expired and the trust funded by the tax dried up, so too did the funding for and pace of these critical cleanups. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Graham amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 289). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Environmental Justice, Toxics, Clean Air and Clean Water"
Mandatory Oil and Gas Leasing on Public Lands,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to mandate unnecessary onshore oil and gas drilling lease sales. The amendment would result in hundreds of thousands of acres of public land being offered for lease, including land with low or no potential for development, land far from existing infrastructure, and land near endangered species habitats. For years to come, this amendment would lock up public land that could be managed for conservation, recreation, or other public good. The oil and gas industry has already stockpiled millions of acres of unused leases, and new leases that are sold would not start producing for years or decades, thus having no impact on current oil prices. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Barrasso amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 291). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Public Lands/Forests"
Striking EPA Funding for Climate Action,"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that would strike a provision in the IRA that provides funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under its existing Clean Air Act authority. This funding would not have added any new regulatory authority to the EPA, and it complied with the Supreme Court’s repeated rulings - including in their 2022 West Virginia v. EPA decision - that greenhouse gasses are air pollutants that may be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The EPA is in the process of developing a series of critical greenhouse gas, environmental, and public health regulations, and this funding would aid this critical work. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Capito amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 293). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Subsequent, but unrelated to this failed vote, the provision to provide additional EPA funding was stricken via a budgetary point of order due to the rules governing budget reconciliation.","Climate Change, Clean Air"
Undermining Bedrock Environmental Statutes,"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that would significantly undercut and weaken multiple bedrock environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act. In effect, the amendment would expedite permitting for oil and gas and other polluting projects, while threatening the health and safety of frontline communities and the environment. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Capito amendment by a vote of 49-50 (Senate roll call vote 300). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice, Clean Air and Clean Water, Other"
Eliminating Cost-saving Home Energy Efficiency Program,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which would eliminate $460 million from the Home Owner Managing Energy Savings (HOMES) rebate program administered by state governments and instead direct the funding to local governments as general supplemental payments. The HOMES program helps residents make their homes more energy efficient and less costly to run and maintain comfortable indoor temperatures by providing increasing amounts of rebates for increasing percentages of energy saved: for a 35% reduction in energy use, a homeowner could get up to $4,000 in rebates, or up to $8,000 for low- and moderate-income homeowners. Redirecting funding from emissions reductions to general purpose would significantly reduce the benefits the bill would have for U.S. households and their energy bills, and our environment. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 49-51 (Senate roll call vote 305). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Clean Energy, Other"
Undermining Environmental Review and Mandating Coal Leasing,"Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to mandate approval of any coal lease application for which a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process has commenced regardless of health, environmental, or economic impacts. Eliminating the requirement of adequate environmental review and public input, as required by NEPA, would only further harm communities on the frontlines of coal mining, processing, transporting, and burning, as well as our climate and public lands. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Shelby amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 306). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice, Climate Change, Public Lands/Forests"
Restarting Construction of the Harmful Border Wall,"Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to replace the funding for the Office of the Chief Readiness Support Officer with a $500 million appropriation for fencing and barriers along the U.S. southern border. This amendment would have continued to waste taxpayer dollars on a hateful and harmful border wall. It would have exacerbated damage to border communities and the environment they depend on, which includes some of the most fragile and sensitive public lands in the U.S., habitat for imperiled species, and vital migration routes for wildlife. On August 7, the Senate rejected the Sullivan amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 320). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Environmental Justice"
Anti-Climate Fossil Fuel Industry Handouts,"The Senate considered en bloc amendment 5487 to H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, that included  anti-environment amendments from Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Steve Daines (R-MT), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Rob Portman (R-OH). These amendments would strike royalty rates for oil and gas extracted from public lands and waters, drastically limit consumer and vehicle eligibility for the clean vehicle tax credits, cut funding for recovery from climate disasters, exempt oil, gas, and coal companies from the newly created corporate minimum tax, and cut assistance to states to modernize their energy codes and lower families’ utility bills. On August 7, the Senate rejected en bloc amendment 5487 by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 321). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Clean Energy, Dirty Energy, Transportation, Climate Change"
Transformational Climate Investments (Inflation Reduction Act),"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 5376, introducing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, to invest roughly $369 billion in climate, clean energy, good jobs, and environmental justice, marking the single largest investment in climate action in U.S. history. The bill incentivizes clean renewable energy, domestic manufacturing, clean vehicles, innovative technologies, and energy efficiency that will save families hundreds of dollars annually, are tied to strong labor provisions, and include added incentives to invest in low-income and fossil-fuel impacted communities. This bill also made a historic $60 billion investment in environmental justice programs, including Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, Clean Ports, Reconnecting Communities, Superfund tax reinstatement, and a methane emissions fee and reductions. At the same time, this bill includes provisions requiring oil and gas lease sales that, if successfully bid upon and subsequently approved for drilling, could subject frontline communities to further harm and are inconsistent with our climate and justice goals. Taken as a whole, however, the IRA is a once-in-a-generation bill that makes transformational investments to protect the planet from current and future climate devastation. On August 7, the Senate approved H.R. 5376, as amended, by a vote of 51- 50, with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote (Senate roll call vote 325). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The president signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law on August 16.","Climate Change, Clean Energy, Clean Air, Environmental Justice"
Ratifying Kigali Treaty to Cut Climate Superpollutants,"After being transmitted to the U.S. Senate by President Joe Biden, the upper chamber considered the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, a United Nations treaty reached in 2016 to significantly phase down the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons – highly potent greenhouse gasses found in air-conditioning systems, insulation, and refrigerators. The amendment also requires signatory parties to establish a licensing system for import and export of hydrofluorocarbons. On September 21, the Senate agreed to the resolution of ratification by a vote of 69-27 (Senate roll call vote 343). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. With this vote, the United States became the 137th country to ratify this treaty. The Environmental Protection Agency had previously issued rules to reduce these climate super-pollutants in line with the treaty’s requirements.",Climate
Disclosing Money in Politics,"Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) sponsored S. 4822, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act of 2022, which would expand the prohibition on campaign spending by foreign nationals and require additional disclosures of campaign expenditures and certain political advertisements. Undisclosed and unlimited secret campaign contributions by fossil fuel interests threaten both our environment and our democracy. They distort our politics and drown out communities of color and communities with low wealth – who are most impacted by the climate crisis and pollution – by giving even more power to polluters and the super wealthy. Supreme Court decisions such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission severely limit Congress’ ability to enact many common-sense limits on money in politics, and this legislation would make significant strides in ensuring the people can see where that money comes from. On September 22, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 4822 by a vote of 49-49 (Senate roll call vote 346). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Freeman Confirmation (Third Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Joe Biden’s nomination of Arianna J. Freeman to serve as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Third Circuit is the most powerful federal court in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware besides the Supreme Court. Federal judges serve for life and the laws that protect our environment and democracy are only as strong as the judges who uphold and enforce them. Prior to her judicial service, Freeman was a long-serving federal public defender in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which includes Philadelphia. Public defenders are a critical bulwark for civil rights and civil liberties in a criminal justice system with pervasive racial disparities. As the first Black woman ever to serve on the Third Circuit, and as a career public-interest lawyer, Freeman brings personal and professional diversity to a judiciary that has long been dominated by White male judges appointed after careers in private law firms or as prosecutors. On September 29, the Senate confirmed Freeman to be a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by a vote of 50-47 (Senate Roll Call Vote 350). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Justice and Democracy
Protecting Marriage Equality,"The Senate considered H.R. 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, as amended, to protect same-sex and interracial marriages under federal law; to require states to accord full faith and credit to out-of-state marriages without discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin; and to provide for enforcement of the right to marriage equality. The rights to same-sex and interracial marriages are protected by the United States Constitution under landmark Supreme Court precedents including Loving v. Virginia, United States v. Windsor, and Obergefell v. Hodges. However, in 2022 the Supreme Court removed a constitutional right for the first time in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which ended the right to abortion access. The decision in Dobbs, as well as Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion explicitly calling for the Court to “reconsider” Obergefell, led House Chair Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and others to propose statutory protections for the right to marriage equality. Additionally, majority support for this bill in Congress highlights the extreme decisions of the current Supreme Court majority, that has also undermined protections for the environment, democracy, and racial justice. On November 29, the Senate approved H.R. 8404 by a vote of 61-36 (Senate roll call vote 362). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House approved the Senate-amended H.R. 8404 on December 8, and the president signed this legislation into law on December 13.",Justice and Democracy
Undermining Environmental Review and Mandating Gas Pipeline,"Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) sponsored the Building American Energy Security Act, which was included as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2023, which had been inserted into H.R. 7776, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). This amendment would allow a broad spectrum of energy-related projects to short circuit environmental review and public input, curtail judicial review, hand project developers veto power over comment period extensions, and require agencies to approve the unnecessary and harmful methane gas Mountain Valley Pipeline, among other damaging actions. Taken together, these changes would further prioritize the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our climate and the health of communities of color and low-wealth communities already disproportionately harmed by fossil fuel extraction, pipelines, processing, and burning. Research indicates that robust public engagement early in project development is more likely to improve projects’ designs, completion timelines, and benefits to communities than shortchanging environmental review and public input. On December 15, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on NDAA with the Manchin amendment by a vote of 47-47 (Senate roll call vote 394). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The Senate subsequently passed the NDAA without Manchin’s legislation on December 15, and the president signed the NDAA into law on December 23.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice, Other"
Certifying Arizona’s Electoral Votes,"Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) objected to the certification of Arizona’s electoral college votes in the 2020 presidential election, peddling unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud. The former president’s and members of Congress’ repeated lies about the election results directly led to the January 6 white supremacist insurrection that stormed the U.S. Capitol and resulted in multiple deaths. Efforts to use lies and conspiracy theories to overturn an election undermine the fundamental democratic principles of our nation and are in direct conflict with the constitutional duties of members of Congress. On January 6, the Senate rejected the objection to Arizona’s electoral college votes by a vote of 6-93 (Senate roll call vote 1). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Arizona’s electoral votes were certified.",Justice and Democracy

Buttigieg Confirmation (Transportation Secretary),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Pete Buttigieg to serve as transportation secretary. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for ensuring that the nation has a safe and efficient transportation system. The transportation sector is now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., and most of these emissions come from passenger vehicles. Under the secretary’s leadership, comprehensive rulemaking, funding, and other actions can help to reduce emissions and drive us to a zero-emission future. Prior to his nomination, Buttigieg advocated for clean, place-based transportation at the local level. Buttigieg also made history as the first openly gay nominee to serve as a Cabinet secretary. On February 2, the Senate confirmed Buttigieg to be secretary of transportation by a vote of 86-13 (Senate roll call vote 11). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Other, Transportation"
Promoting Drilling for Fossil Fuels,"Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 5, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution, which would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) from proposing rules or guidance that would ban fracking, a destructive process of oil and gas drilling, in the United States -- an authority that the EPA and CEQ do not currently have. This was a symbolic amendment, demonstrating a desire to keep us addicted to fossil fuels. On February 4, the Senate approved the Braun amendment by a vote of 57-43 (Senate roll call vote 28). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.The Braun amendment was not included in the final S. Con. Res.5, which was approved by the House on February 5.  ","Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Supporting the Destructive Keystone XL Pipeline,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 5, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution, which would keep the Keystone XL pipeline alive at the bequest of oil and gas CEOs. The Keystone XL pipeline would threaten numerous waterways, drinking water sources, and Indigenous lands across the Great Plains, and undercut the credibility and influence of the United States when urging other countries to take ambitious climate action, ultimately undermining U.S. climate leadership. The United States must exercise vigorous climate leadership to achieve a significant increase in global climate action and put the world on a sustainable climate pathway. On February 5, the Senate approved the Daines amendment by a vote of 52-48 (Senate roll call vote 32). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The Daines amendment was not included in the final S. Con. Res. 5, which was approved by the House on February 5.","Dirty Energy, Environmental Justice"
Bolstering the Dirty Water Rule,"Senator Shelley Capito (R-WV) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 5, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution, which threatened to lock in place the Trump administration’s dangerous “Dirty Water Rule” and prohibit the EPA from crafting stronger regulations to protect critical waterways like our streams and wetlands. The Dirty Water Rule represented the most severe weakening of federal Clean Water Act protections in the law’s history, jeopardizing the waters our families and communities depend on. It is critical that the EPA is able to replace this disastrous law with protections that are grounded in science and protect public health and the environment. On February 5, the Senate approved the Capito amendment by a vote of 51-49 (Senate roll call vote 43). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Although it is a symbolic amendment, the Capito amendment was included in the final S. Con. Res. 5, which was approved by the House on February 5. ",Clean Water
Impeachment for Incitement of Insurrection,"The House delivered articles of impeachment to the Senate, H. Res. 24, impeaching President Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection. Trump encouraged and incited the deadly mob on January 6, and he perpetuated the unfounded and harmful claims about the 2020 election that inspired their actions. The riot caused multiple deaths and directly threatened our democratic process, and the president responded with inaction, followed by further defense of the violent behavior. Holding elected officials accountable and ensuring our elections remain free and fair are essential for the preservation of our democracy.

Granholm Confirmation (Energy Secretary),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Jennifer Granholm to serve as secretary of energy. The Department of Energy oversees the country’s energy, environmental and nuclear policy with a focus on transformative science and technology solutions. As Michigan governor, Granholm led policies that reduce pollution, accelerate clean energy, and promote environmental justice. Additionally, Granholm’s experience helping to rebuild the American auto industry during the last recession is invaluable as the Biden-Harris administration works to deliver a 100% clean energy economy. On February 25, the Senate confirmed Granholm to be secretary of energy by a vote of 64-35 (Senate roll call vote 66). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Other, Clean Energy"
Raimondo Confirmation (Commerce Secretary),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Gina M. Raimondo to serve as secretary of commerce. The secretary of commerce oversees the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and is well positioned to strengthen the agency’s mission, reestablish a culture of scientific integrity, and lead on ocean conservation. As the first female governor of Rhode Island, Raimondo committed Rhode Island to 100% renewable energy by 2030, and oversaw the development of the first offshore wind farm in the United States. Raimondo’s firsthand experience transitioning to a clean energy economy that creates good paying jobs at every skill level is a valuable asset to the Department of Commerce. On March 2, the Senate confirmed Raimondo to be secretary of commerce by a vote of 84-15 (Senate roll call vote 70). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Oceans"
Striking Provisions to Help Farmers of Color,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which would have stricken a provision to provide $5 billion in aid, largely in the form of debt relief to disadvantaged farmers of color, who have historically been marginalized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The combination of systemic racism and the federal government’s well-documented discriminatory policies and actions has led Black farmers to lose 90% of their farmland over the last century, and the number of Black farmers has dropped from 1 million to only 45,000 today. The COVID-19 pandemic only further exacerbated and highlighted the lack of support for farmers of color. The Toomey amendment undermined attempts to advance equity and begin addressing historic injustices farmers of color have experienced because of the USDA. On March 6, the Senate rejected the Toomey amendment by a vote of 49-50 (Senate roll call vote 86). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Environmental Justice, Agriculture"

As a member of Congress, Fudge built a strong record advocating for environmental justice and earned a lifetime 93% LCV score. Her leadership of HUD will be crucial in building healthier, more climate-resilient communities and promoting safe, affordable, and energy-efficient housing. Additionally, HUD will play a key role in building up resilience in urban communities and making renewable energy available to frontline communities.

Garland Confirmation (Attorney General),"The Senate considered President Biden’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to serve as attorney general. As the nation’s top law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice is responsible for safeguarding our civil and constitutional rights, including our right to live free from toxic air and polluted waters. Garland presided over several critical environmental cases as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by former President Obama in 2016. His even-handed and science-based approach will restore independence and integrity to the department, rebuild public trust in the rule of law, prioritize the robust enforcement of our environmental and civil rights laws, protect the fundamental right to vote, fight for environmental justice and seek the fair application of justice.

As a 12-term congressman, Becerra was an environmental champion, earning a lifetime LCV score of 91%. In his role as California state attorney general, he continually fought for equity and justice – for example, Becerra established an environmental justice branch for the California Department of Justice, championed protections for women, LGBTQ+ people, and people of color in healthcare, and sued the Trump administration over 60 times for their discriminatory and dangerous policies, including efforts to declare a national emergency as an excuse to build the environmentally damaging and xenophobic wall on the southern border. Our health and our environment are intrinsically linked, and Becerra’s outstanding leadership and experience helps to ensure the administration delivers on their goals to eliminate systemic racial injustice, including the disproportionate pollution burden borne by communities of color, and create a cleaner, healthier future for everyone.

Repealing Assault on Methane Pollution Safeguards,"Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sponsored S.J. Res. 14, the Congressional Review Act Resolution of Disapproval of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule to roll back the 2016 methane standards for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry is the largest source of industrial methane pollution, causing almost 25% of the climate change we currently experience. S.J. Res. 14 eliminates this dangerous rule and allows the EPA to move quickly on stronger safeguards against methane pollution, which will slow climate change and mitigate hazardous air pollutants that affect our communities, especially low-income communities and communities of color living on the frontlines of oil and gas drilling and processing. On April 28, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 14 by a vote of 52-42 (Senate roll call vote 175). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The president signed S.J. Res. 14 into law on June 30.

Investing in Water Infrastructure,"Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) sponsored S. 914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021 (DWWIA), which authorized increased funding for new and existing drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater programs to help provide clean water to communities across the country. Unfortunately, too many families still have to worry if the water coming from their taps is harming their families, and communities of color and low-wealth communities have disproportionately borne the brunt of water pollution and lack of investment in our water systems. S. 914 authorized funds for replacing lead service lines, reauthorized the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, started a pilot program at EPA for low-income water assistance, and authorized funding for rural and disadvantaged communities, among other measures. The legislation was an important step in ensuring everyone, no matter race, zip code, or economic status, has access to the clean water they need to thrive. On April 29, the Senate approved S. 914 by a vote of 89-2 (Senate roll call vote 178). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.

Jackson was previously appointed by President Obama to serve as a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which she did for eight years immediately preceding her elevation to the D.C. Circuit. President Obama also appointed her to serve as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission. During her time in that role, the commission took concrete action to reduce mass incarceration and ameliorate longstanding racist sentencing disparities related to the war on drugs. As a district judge, Jackson issued rulings in favor of disability rights, labor rights, immigrants’ rights, and a congressional subpoena related to the first impeachment investigation of President Trump.

Voting Rights and Democracy Reforms,"Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sponsored S. 2093, the For the People Act, a sweeping democracy reform bill that would address a range of threats to our democracy by expanding voting rights, strengthening ethics reforms, and reducing the influence of money in our elections. Everyone’s right to be heard and counted in the political process is essential to the function of our democracy and protection of our environment, and far too often people of color and frontline communities are targeted by restrictive voting laws and partisan gerrymandering. By ensuring that voters have access to the ballot box and their voices are not drowned out by outsized corporate interests, the people will be better equipped to hold politicians accountable and accomplish meaningful climate action.

Promoting Polluting Energy Sources,"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) offered an amendment to S. Con. Res. 14, the FY2022 budget resolution, which encourages deployment and use of coal and methane power plants with carbon capture and storage technology, and nuclear power plants. This amendment would protect these polluting industries from further oversight and is inspired by repeated failed attempts to further subsidize coal plants to keep them running under the false premise that coal retirements threaten grid reliability. When cold temperatures caused massive failures in fossil fuel generation and blackouts across Texas, it showed that propping up dirty fossil fuels will not prevent power outages or increase grid resiliency, and will increase the frequency of climate change-fueled extreme weather events. Rather, clean renewable energy paired with energy storage is the best way to improve resiliency and reduce unhealthy climate and air pollution, particularly in frontline communities. On August 11, the Senate approved the Hoeven amendment by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 346). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Although it is a symbolic amendment, the Hoeven amendment was included in the final S. Con. Res. 14, which was considered adopted in the House on August 24.","Dirty Energy, Climate Change, Air"
Build Back Better Budget Resolution,"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sponsored S. Con. Res. 14, the FY2022 budget resolution. Passage of the budget resolution set in motion the legislative procedure needed to pass President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to take action to tackle the climate crisis in a way that addresses racial and economic inequality and creates millions of good jobs. The Build Back Better investments would set the U.S. on a path to cutting carbon pollution by at least half by 2030 and 100% carbon-free energy powering our electricity grid, new cars, buses, and buildings by 2035, while delivering at least 40% of benefits to communities of color and low-income communities that have borne the brunt of fossil fuel pollution.

In addition to restoring the protections of the 1965 law that was undermined by the Supreme Court in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and Shelby County v. Holder, S. 4 would update them to better address the modern forms of voter suppression seen in hundreds of anti-voter bills filed in state legislatures across the country in 2021. This legislation is a critical step toward ensuring that communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis across the country have their access to the ballot box protected.  This Senate version of the bill covers further ground than the House companion bill, by incorporating the proposed Native American Voting Rights Act, which would help native voters and tribal governments ensure equal access to the franchise despite unique obstacles these voters often face.

The deal threatens our climate and communities by continuing to support fossil fuel development, including dirty tar sands oil and fracked natural gas, and allowing oil and gas companies in Mexico to challenge environmental and climate regulations through the Investor-State Dispute Settlement system, all while failing to recommit the U.S. to the Paris Climate Agreement. Additionally, the deal fell far short on what is necessary to significantly strengthen enforcement mechanisms, protect against illegal flora and fauna trade, or address outsourcing and dumping of toxic pollution into air and water. Ultimately, the final agreement helps corporate polluters and wasted a critical opportunity to address the climate crisis and environmental issues created by international trade.

Inadequate Policing Reform,"Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) sponsored S. 3985, the JUSTICE Act, which would inadequately address the need for comprehensive policing reform. Black people have endured systemic racism and abusive policing practices for generations, but the mere incremental reforms and increased police funding of S. 3985 fail to address the priorities of racial justice organizations. Despite the outcry from racial justice organizations and activists following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake and many others, S. 3985 fails to address racial profiling, no-knock warrants, militarization equipment, or restrictions on use of force such as chokeholds. Environmental justice requires racial and social justice, and an effort to pass a legislative half-measure instead of meaningful change is unacceptable.

Inadequate COVID Relief Package,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) attempted a vote on a bare-bones COVID-19 relief package instead of taking up a bill that met the needs of the country. In the midst of a raging pandemic that was causing disproportionate suffering in communities of color and Trump’s appointee as Postmaster General attempting to sway the upcoming election by delaying the delivery of mail-in ballots, the proposal would provide little funding for testing or public health response and merely provide loan forgiveness for the U.S. Postal Service and only if the agency got into even more dire financial straits. Unfortunately, it also would let companies off the hook for actions that endanger their employees, customers, and broader community. Among other failings, this inadequate bill would not have provided critical relief in the form of additional funding for state and local governments, vote-by-mail and election assistance to ensure smooth operation of our democracy, or a moratorium on utility disconnects at a time when it is even more essential for homes to have clean water for hand washing and heat and cooling, since community warming or cooling centers would defeat social distancing efforts. And it would provide unrelated and unnecessary support to extractive industries and coal companies. Environmental justice requires addressing the gross inequities and disproportionate impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, and liability-erasing legislative half-measures are unacceptable.

Miller Confirmation (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Eric Miller to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the Ninth Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. In particular, the Ninth Circuit is critically important for environmental issues, covering nearly two-thirds of the nation’s public land and over half of all endangered species. LCV is committed to furthering racial justice and equity, and Miller has repeatedly challenged tribal rights, recognition and sovereignty, including through pro bono representation. We share the concerns of the National Council of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund, who strongly opposed Miller’s nomination and questioned his ability to rule fairly on cases involving tribal issues. Moreover, Miller’s record, including his writings and public statements, reflect a view of the legal system as a tool to protect corporations, rather than the public interest.

Wheeler’s inherent conflicts of interest, which stem from his long history of ties to the fossil fuel industry, and actions to undermine public health and environmental safeguards as deputy administrator of the EPA made him an entirely inappropriate choice for leading the agency. On February 28, the Senate confirmed Wheeler to be administrator of the EPA by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 33). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Clean Air, Clean Water"
Rao Confirmation (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Neomi Rao to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the D.C. Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), Rao led efforts to roll back fundamental environmental protections and misuse the regulatory review process for partisan political purposes. Rao spent the past 20 years arguing against environmental and other public protections, disparaging efforts to keep our air and water clean as unnecessary burdens on corporate freedom, and even referring to the greenhouse effect as a “controversial theory.” Her long record on this issue, as well as her offensive and demeaning writings on sexual assault, race, and LGBTQ rights made it clear that she is incapable of serving fairly as a federal judge. On March 13, the Senate confirmed Rao to the D.C. Circuit by a vote of 53-46 (Senate roll call vote 44). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Justice and Democracy"
Wyrick Confirmation (District Court for Western District of Oklahoma),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Patrick Wyrick to be a U.S. District Court judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. It is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on our federal courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As Solicitor General for Oklahoma, Wyrick was former Oklahoma Attorney General and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s “dear friend and trusted counselor”—they worked together on multiple cases that challenged the EPA’s ability to protect public lands and clean air and address climate change. Wyrick’s record also raised serious ethical concerns. He made several inaccurate statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, including about his involvement in his wife’s business, his conflicts with oil and gas companies, and his false statements before the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 9, the Senate confirmed Wyrick to the Western District of Oklahoma by a vote of 53-47 (Senate roll call vote 68). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Justice and Democracy"
Bernhardt Confirmation (Interior Secretary),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of David Bernhardt to serve as the secretary of the Department of the Interior (DOI). This position is critical to protecting our natural resources for future generations, but Bernhardt’s confirmation put our public lands and oceans, national parks and monuments, clean air and water, and wildlife at risk. With his long history of lobbying for the very industries under the Department of the Interior’s purview—creating numerous conflicts of interest—and his proximity to ethics scandals during his roles as acting Interior secretary and deputy secretary, it is clear Bernhardt has not put the public interest first. Bernhardt was the architect of some of the Trump administration’s most destructive natural resource policies, including overseeing the largest elimination of protected public lands and waters in U.S. history through President Trump’s unprecedented attempt to rescind two million acres of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, a radical expansion of offshore drilling, and the fast-tracking of efforts to drill in the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  On April 11, the Senate confirmed Bernhardt to be secretary of the Department of the Interior by a vote of 56-41 (Senate roll call vote 77). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Drilling, Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Other"
Jorjani Confirmation (Interior Solicitor),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Daniel Jorjani to serve as the solicitor  of the Department of the Interior (DOI). This position is the top lawyer for DOI, and is the bottom line on legal issues and ethics for the department. Before joining DOI, Jorjani held several positions with groups funded by the well-known oil magnates, the Koch brothers. Prior to his confirmation, Jorjani served as Interior’s Principal Deputy Solicitor and was responsible for providing legal guidance for some of the Interior Department’s most egregious decisions in support of Trump’s“energy dominance” agenda. Time and again his legal opinions  benefitted oil, gas, mining or extractive interests at the expense of conservation and public health. Jorjani has also demonstrated an aversion to transparency, including restricting Freedom of Information Act responses and justifying Interior Secretary Bernhardt’s troubling practice of not maintaining a calendar, which made it harder for the public to know with whom he has been meeting.  Jorjani’s ties to the fossil fuel industry and efforts to hinder transparency within the Department put him at odds with the core mission of the office of the solicitor. On September 24, the Senate confirmed Jorjani to be the solicitor of the Department of the Interior by a vote of 51-43 (Senate roll call vote 300). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Other, Lands/Forests"
Scalia Confirmation (Labor Secretary),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Eugene Scalia to serve as the secretary of the Department of Labor (DOL). This position is critical to protecting labor rights and the safety of our workers as we transition to a clean energy economy, but Scalia’s confirmation puts workers and our communities at risk. He has a long history of working on behalf of corporate interests who have fought health and safety standards, including representing Big Oil’s fight against refinery safety regulations following catastrophic refinery fires across the nation. Efforts to transition to a clean energy economy require strong labor protections to keep workers safe, ensure greater equity and establish family-sustaining jobs. Scalia’s record starkly contrasts with these goals as well as the very mission of the Department of Labor.  On September 26, the Senate confirmed Scalia to be secretary of the Department of Labor by a vote of 53-44 (Senate roll call vote 313). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Stopping Rollbacks of Carbon Pollution Limits for Power Plants,"Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) sponsored S.J. Res. 53, the resolution of disapproval of the Trump administration EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy rule. In addition to demonstrating the broad opposition to the rule, if enacted, the resolution would invalidate the rule. Trump’s rule, more accurately titled the Dirty Power Scam, is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring science and favoring polluters over the public interest. This rule does nothing to fight climate change or protect communities from toxic pollution, and it lets fossil fuel-fired power plants off the hook to clean up their carbon pollution. The Dirty Power Scam would put no meaningful limits on carbon pollution, and, in fact, could lead to more pollution in many parts of the country than if there were no standard at all. On October 17, the Senate rejected S.J. Res. 53 by a vote of 41-53 (Senate roll call vote 324). YES IS THE PRO ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Undermining the Land and Water Conservation Fund,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to H.R. 3055, the Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2020, which would undermine the Land and Water Conservation Fund’s (LWCF) core conservation mission by jeopardizing the program’s ability to acquire lands for new or expanded LWCF sites. LWCF secures vital public access to green spaces; protects wildlife and other irreplaceable resources; help agencies reduce costs and address ongoing management issues (such as invasive species and wildfires); and enhances outdoor recreation opportunities. The rejection of this amendment is a victory for our nation’s best parks program and for all those who cherish our public lands. On October 31, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 29-64. NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Lands/Forests
Border Wall Funding & Anti-Immigrant Policy,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) offered an amendment to H.R. 2579, which would have funded the environmentally destructive and xenophobic border wall and advanced anti-immigrant policies. The border wall threatens communities living along our southern border, has far ranging negative impacts on our lands, wildlife and waterways, and circumvents bedrock environmental laws. This amendment would spend nearly $25 billion on an ineffective and damaging border wall and military technology, and would waive 36 environmental and cultural laws for construction of the wall and other border enforcement activities on federal lands within 100 miles of both the northern and southern borders. The Grassley amendment also includes policies that would cause significant harm to immigrant families, including gutting family immigration and eliminating the diversity visa lottery program. On February 15, the Senate rejected the Grassley amendment by a vote of 39-60 (Senate roll call vote 36). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other

Exposing Waterways to Invasive Species,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) offered S. 1129, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act, as an amendment to S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Reauthorization Act. This amendment included the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA), which would leave our waters more vulnerable to aquatic invasive species by exempting the shipping industry from requirements under the Clean Water Act in favor of a new, weaker regulatory scheme. By shifting the EPA’s authority to regulate ballast water to the Coast Guard, VIDA would set a dangerous precedent for transferring authority to agencies that are ill-equipped to handle the responsibility. In addition, VIDA would pre-empt the states’ capacity to enact and enforce their own ballast water rules, undermining their ability to protect their waterways from pollution and invasive species. Lastly, VIDA would exempt ships in geographically restricted areas -- such as the Great Lakes -- from any regulation, further jeopardizing some of our most iconic water bodies. On April 18, the Senate rejected the McConnell amendment by a vote of 56-42 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 77). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Wildlife, Clean Water"
Bridenstine Confirmation (NASA Administrator),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Representative Jim Bridenstine for administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Bridenstine’s extreme views of NASA’s mission, his voting record, his many scientifically inaccurate statements, and his lack of qualifications make him an unacceptable choice for NASA administrator. His voting record is at odds with NASA’s mission and shows a history of opposition to science-based environmental standards and support for weakening agencies’ use of science in decision-making. As recently as 2016, Bridenstine sought to change the mission of NASA by authoring legislation that essentially stripped out Earth Science and Earth Observing Missions. Scientists, researchers, and individuals across the country rely on this data and the continuity of its collection to understand, forecast, and respond to changes in land use, pollutant emissions, atmospheric chemistry, weather and climate, and other phenomena. On April 19, the Senate confirmed Bridenstine to be administrator of NASA by a vote of 50-49 (Senate roll call vote 80). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Pompeo Confirmation (Secretary of State),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Representative Mike Pompeo to serve as secretary of state. The secretary of state is tasked with carrying out the president’s foreign policy agenda and plays a key role in shaping international climate policy. Pompeo has deep ties to the Koch Brothers and has consistently favored polluting fossil fuel interests. During his time in Congress, Pompeo voted against protecting public health, conserving imperiled species, and advancing renewable energy, earning an abysmal 4 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. Pompeo’s anti-environmental record, climate science denial, preference for war over diplomacy, and hostility to human rights should be disqualifying. On April 26, the Senate confirmed Pompeo to be secretary of state by a vote of 57-42 (Senate roll call vote 84). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Other"
Anti-Environmental Rescission Package,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) sponsored H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act, also known as the rescission package, which would have cut funding for several programs that protect our environment and public health. H.R. 3 would slash programs that promote needed investments in clean energy and conservation, as well as $16 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Additionally, this package, which the Trump administration proposed, irresponsibly rescinds funding levels agreed upon by Congress, and much of the funding that H.R. 3 would cut has been identified for future use and could continue to support projects and communities across the country. On June 20, the Senate rejected a motion to discharge H.R. 3 by a vote of 48-50 (Senate roll call vote 134). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Oldham Confirmation (Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Andrew Oldham to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Fifth Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As deputy solicitor general for the State of Texas and general counsel to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Oldham frequently challenged federal environmental protections and efforts to address climate change. In his personal capacity, Oldham has questioned the constitutionality of the EPA, calling it “illegitimate.” He has also taken strong stances against immigrant rights and voting rights, supporting challenges to the Voting Rights Act and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Oldham’s partisan and anti-environment record are disqualifying for a judicial nominee. On July 18, the Senate confirmed Oldham to the Fifth Circuit by a vote of 50-49 (Senate roll call vote 160). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Judiciary
Grant Confirmation (Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Britt Grant to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Eleventh Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases, including those involving environmental protections, and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. As solicitor general for the state of Georgia, Grant repeatedly fought to weaken the Endangered Species Act, one of our nation’s most successful conservation programs. She has also sought to weaken the Voting Rights Act, and opposed LGBTQ equality and immigrant rights. Grant’s partisan and anti-environment record are disqualifying for a judicial nominee.

Justices on the court have an impact lasting generations, and it is essential that they respect precedent, interpret the law in a fair and wellreasoned manner, and act as an independent check on the president. Kavanaugh’s record reflects a concerning preference for corporations and polluters over public health and the environment. In repeated rulings he has shown hostility towards the Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to strike down fundamental protections of our air and water. In addition to his environmental record, the credible sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh are disqualifying for a nominee to the Supreme Court. On October 5, the Senate invoked cloture on Kavanaugh’s nomination by a vote of 51-49 (Senate roll call vote 222). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Judiciary

The mission of the ENRD is to enforce the nation’s environmental laws to ensure clean air, water and land for all people in this country. Clark is an outspoken opponent of environmental and public health protections, and a well-known climate change denier. He has spent his career undermining the protections ENRD is tasked with enforcing, making him unfit to lead the division.

Nelson Confirmation (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Ryan Nelson to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Ninth Circuit. Circuit courts are often the ultimate arbiters of highly significant cases and it is critical that the judges confirmed to serve lifetime appointments on these courts are qualified, non-partisan, and committed to treating parties fairly. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit, the largest circuit court covering nearly three-quarters of the United States’ public lands, serves a crucial role in deciding some of our nation’s most important environmental cases. During his time in the Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD), Nelson oversaw the legal defense of the President George W. Bush administration’s efforts to benefit polluters and roll back critical environmental protections. This included helping the government argue against regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in Massachusetts v. EPA. On July 31, the Senate confirmed Nelson to the Ninth Circuit by a vote of 51-44 (Senate roll call vote 232). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Judiciary
McNamee Confirmation (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Bernard McNamee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). An independent agency that oversees transactions in the U.S. wholesale power market, FERC has historically been a non-partisan entity that is committed to ensuring just and reasonable energy rates. However, in McNamee’s previous role at the Department of Energy, he took steps to bailout the coal industry and weaken renewable energy’s growing foothold in the U.S. power sector. As an outspoken climate doubter and renewable energy critic, it is clear McNamee is unable to be a non-partisan, unbiased FERC commissioner. On December 6, the Senate confirmed McNamee to FERC by a vote of 50-49 (Senate roll call vote 254). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Clean Air"
Farm Bill Conference Report,"Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and led negotiations on the 2018 Farm Bill, officially titled H.R. 2, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. These negotiations resulted in a bipartisan conference report, which was essentially free of environmentally harmful provisions. The conference committee removed a number of anti-environmental attacks that were in the House-passed Farm Bill, including language that would have jeopardized our clean water, cut money from critical conservation programs, eviscerated protections for endangered species, and undercut our bedrock environmental laws. Instead, the final Farm Bill conference report provided new tools to conserve and restore our land, water, and forests, including maintaining funding for conservation programs, new incentives to help farmers improve water quality and soil health, support for clean energy and energy efficiency for small businesses and farmers, expanded opportunities for outdoor recreation, and new funding to encourage growth of the organic sector. On December 11, the Senate passed the Farm Bill conference report 87-13 (Senate roll call vote 259). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.

Extreme Assault on the Stream Protection Rule (CRA),"Representative Bill Johnson (R-OH) sponsored H.J. Res. 38, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” of the Stream Protection Rule, which would threaten the drinking water and public health of communities living near coal mining operations by permanently blocking the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Stream Protection Rule. This important rule set commonsense requirements for coal mining to better protect ground water, surface water, and ecosystems from toxic coal mining waste, which has been linked to increased rates of cancer, birth defects, and other health problems in nearby communities. The rule protects 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, set up new requirements for water quality monitoring and restoration, and generally compels coal mining companies to reduce their impact on the surrounding environment. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit DOI from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future. Following its passage in the House, on February 2, the Senate approved H.J. Res. 38 by a vote of 54-45 (Senate roll call vote 43). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Trump signed H.J.

This rule helped bring transparency to the flow of money between fossil fuel companies on the U.S. stock exchanges and U.S. and foreign governments, deterring corruption and mismanagement among all parties. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit the SEC from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future. Following its passage in the House, on February 3, the Senate approved H.J. Res. 41 by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 51). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Trump signed H.J.

The attorney general is responsible for defending and enforcing laws that ensure justice, safety, health and wellness for all people in this country. Sessions has publicly denied the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is real and caused by human activity, and he has repeatedly questioned the need for safeguards from the Environmental Protection Agency, earning a 6 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. In 1986, the Senate rejected Sessions’ nomination for a federal judgeship over concerns about prejudice and overt racism, and he has supported strict voter ID laws that restrict access to the ballot. Sessions’ record made it clear that he would not be an arbiter of justice and truth for all people and would not defend the laws that protect people’s health.

Therefore, OMB has influence over environmental and public health safeguards, as well as funding levels for environmental priorities. Mulvaney denies the scientific consensus on climate change and repeatedly voted against environmental safeguards as a congressman, earning a 7 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. Mulvaney has also rejected the scientific consensus on other issues, such as the link between the Zika virus and birth defects, and he has questioned the need for government funded scientific research.

Pruitt Confirmation (EPA Administrator),"The Senate considered President Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt to serve as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA and its leader are charged with protecting human health and the environment – our air, water, and land. In his role as the Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times, attempting to block efforts to cut carbon pollution and weaken safeguards for our air and water. Pruitt has repeatedly denied the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity and has extremely close ties to fossil fuel interests. During his confirmation process, Pruitt refused repeated requests to turn over email correspondence between his Oklahoma attorney general’s office and oil and gas companies. By ignoring sound science and showing no interest in upholding our nation’s bedrock environmental and public health laws, Pruitt failed to meet the most basic standards needed to perform this job in good faith.

This position is critical to protecting our treasured natural heritage for future generations, but Zinke puts our public lands, national monuments and parks, clean air and water, and wildlife at risk. Zinke’s record on protecting America’s majestic public lands has far too often failed to meet his pro-conservation rhetoric, resulting in a 4 percent lifetime score on LCV’s National Environmental Scorecard. Zinke has refused to accept the reality of climate science and consistently put the interests of corporate polluters ahead of our air, water, lands, and wildlife.

Blocking Local Input about Public Lands (CRA),"Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY) sponsored H.J. Res 44, the Congressional Review Act ""Resolution of Disapproval"" of the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) “Planning 2.0” Rule. The “Planning 2.0” Rule allows BLM – which is responsible for managing more than 245 million acres of public lands – to approach the management of public lands in a more holistic way that considers conservation and outdoor recreation needs by increasing the participation of local stakeholders and engaging them earlier in the planning process. Repealing this rule would result in BLM reverting back to an outdated land management planning process that has not been updated for over three decades. Additionally, this use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit BLM from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future.

Blocking Wildlife Protections in Alaska (CRA),"Representative Don Young (R-AK) sponsored H.J. Res 69, the Congressional Review Act ""Resolution of Disapproval"" of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) Alaska National Wildlife Refuges Rule. This rule protects wildlife from the intensive predator control policy designed by the state of Alaska, which aims to significantly suppress the populations of native carnivores in order to artificially inflate game populations. The state’s predator control policy is not based on sound science and permits extreme and inhumane practices. These practices include killing wolves and bears in their dens, bear baiting, and using airplanes to scout and hunt bears. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit FWS from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" protections in the future.

Justices on the Supreme Court have an immense responsibility to protect the rights of the people in this country and to interpret the constitution without personal ideological influence. In the coming decade, the Supreme Court will tackle critical issues relating to voting rights and the environment, both of which will have lasting impacts for generations to come. Gorsuch’s record reflects support for corporations at the expense of the public interest. His stance on the “Chevron doctrine” and demonstrated hostility towards the regulatory power of federal agencies could undermine the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to enforce safeguards against polluters. On April 7, the Senate approved Gorsuch’s confirmation by a vote of 54-45 (Senate roll call vote 111). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Extreme Assault on the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule (CRA),"Representative Rob Bishop (R-UT) sponsored H.J. Res. 36, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” of the Methane and Waste Prevention Rule, which would block efforts to reduce dangerous methane pollution released by the oil and gas industry on our public and tribal lands. The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Methane Rule established commonsense standards that require oil and gas companies to deploy readily available, cost-effective measures to reduce methane lost through venting, flaring, and leaks. The rule helps to decrease the over $300 million in natural gas that is wasted each year from our public and tribal lands and to provide up to $800 million in royalty revenues to states, tribes, and federal taxpayers over the next decade. Additionally, the Methane Rule reduces the methane pollution that contributes to climate change as well as hazardous air pollutants that damage the health of local communities by contributing to increased asthma attacks and other respiratory ailments. This use of the Congressional Review Act, an extreme legislative tool, would not only overturn the current rule, but would prohibit BLM from ever issuing ""substantially similar"" regulations in the future.

Bernhardt’s long history of lobbying for many of the industries—including oil and gas, mining, and developers—under DOI's regulatory purview creates numerous conflicts of interest. Additionally, Bernhardt’s career is marked by many instances of fighting against federal environmental safeguards, and he has been in close proximity to ethics scandals during his previous tenure at DOI. Finally, during his confirmation hearing, Bernhardt would not commit to leading the agency to tackle the urgent challenge of climate change and the dangers it poses to our natural resources. On July 24, the Senate confirmed Bernhardt to be deputy secretary of the Interior by a vote of 53-43 (Senate roll call vote 166). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Other"
Undermining Federal Safeguards for Protected Species,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to H.Con.Res. 71, the Budget Resolution, which called for legislation to undermine the protection of plants and wildlife listed under the Endangered Species Act. The Lee amendment would strip federal safeguards for protected species found entirely within the borders of a single state, including all listed plants and animals in Hawaii. The fate of about 77 percent of all federally protected species would thus depend on state laws and funding, but states generally lack the programs and resources necessary to recover listed species and ultimately prevent their declines and extinctions. On October 19, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 49-51 (Senate roll call vote 242). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ",Wildlife
Protecting the Arctic Refuge,"Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) sponsored an amendment to H.Con.Res. 71, the Budget Resolution. This amendment would remove the budget reconciliation instructions that paved the way for drilling in the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The indigenous Gwich’in people call the Arctic Refuge’s coastal plain “the sacred place where life begins,” reflecting the importance and the need to protect this special place. These reconciliation instructions for Arctic drilling were included in the Budget Resolution as an attempt to generate $1 billion in government revenue to somehow justify $1.5 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthy, but multiple analyses show that it is unlikely to raise anywhere close to even that amount. On October 19, the Senate rejected the Cantwell amendment by a vote of 48-52 (Senate roll call vote 243). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The budget resolution, including the Arctic Refuge drilling instructions was adopted on October 26.","Lands/Forests, Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Budget Resolution Paving the Way for Drilling in the Arctic Refuge,"Representative Diane Black (R-TN) sponsored H.Con.Res. 71, the Budget Resolution, which authorized an increase in the deficit of $1.5 trillion to enact the GOP tax bill and will likely result in cuts to safeguards for our air, water, lands and wildlife. The legislation paved the way for the tax bill to include a rider that turns the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge into an industrial oil field.  On October 19, the Senate approved H.Con.Res. 71 by a vote of 51-49 (Senate roll call vote 245). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House passed the Senate version of the budget on October 26 and the resolution was adopted.","Lands/Forests, Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Eid Confirmation (10th Circuit Court of Appeals),"The Senate considered President Trump’s nomination of Allison Eid to the Tenth Circuit U.S Court of Appeals. Lower court judges have an immense responsibility to protect the rights of the people of this country and to interpret the constitution without personal ideological influence. It is the lower court judges who often serve as the final arbiter of justice. Unfortunately, Eid has a disturbing history of siding with corporate polluters over the environment and public health. She has written academic pieces that applaud the outcome of the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. US Army Corps of Engineers decision, which created confusion over the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. In Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission v. Grand Valley Citizens’ Alliance, Eid sided with oil companies, allowing them to bypass public hearings and local input before obtaining drilling permits. On November 2, the Senate confirmed Eid to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals by a vote of 56-41 (Senate roll call vote 259). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
"Wehrum Confirmation (Assistant Administrator, EPA)","The Senate considered President Trump's nomination of William Wehrum to serve as assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR). This important office at the EPA plays a key role in protecting people from air pollution and radiation exposure, making this position critical to maintaining and enforcing public health safeguards. But Wehrum’s long history of representing many of the industries—utilities, energy companies, and other major polluters—that are attempting to roll back safeguards issued under the Clean Air Act, make him unfit to serve in this position. Additionally, during his previous tenure at the OAR from 2001 to 2007, Wehrum led efforts to weaken safeguards to reduce mercury emissions from coal fired power plants and other safeguards intended to reduce lead, fine particulate pollution, and ozone smog pollution. On November 9, the Senate confirmed Wehrum to be assistant administrator of OAR by a vote of 49-47 (Senate roll call vote 268). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ","Climate Change, Clean Air, Other"
Anti-Environmental Tax Bill that Opens Drilling in the Arctic Refuge,"Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX) sponsored H.R. 1, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which sells out key environmental priorities to deliver a massive tax cut for millionaires, billionaires, and huge corporations. The bill increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion, harming people nationwide by likely resulting in cuts to safeguards for our air, water, lands and wildlife. The legislation puts our clean energy future at risk while maintaining giveaways to fossil fuel interests. The conference report for H.R. 1 even turns the pristine and sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge into an industrial oil field. Following its passage in the House, on December 20, the Senate approved the conference report for H.R. 1 by a vote of 51-48 (Senate roll call vote 323). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Trump signed H.R. 1 into law on December 22.","Lands/Forests, Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Extreme Attack on Clean Water Protections (CRA),"Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored S.J. Res. 22, a Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval,” which would void the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule that protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of 117 million people in this country. Not only would this radical legislative tool vacate the current rule, it would also prohibit the agencies from developing any “substantially similar” rule in the future, keeping the unworkable status quo in place. This could prevent the agencies from ever issuing rules that establish Clean Water Act protections for the waters covered by the Clean Water Rule, leaving our streams, wetlands, lakes, and rivers vulnerable to pollution for generations to come. On January 19, President Obama vetoed S.J. Res. 22. On January 21, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to the S.J. Res. 22 veto override by a vote of 52-40 (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 5). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Water
Clean Energy Funding,"Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would increase funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, an important Department of Energy research program intended to spur transformational breakthroughs in energy technologies. Additional funding for this program could help the United States lead in the clean energy transformation. On January 28, the Senate approved the Schatz amendment by a vote of 55-37 (Senate roll call vote 9). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. S. 2012 passed the Senate and moved to conference with a House-passed energy bill, but did not become law.",Clean Energy
National Monuments,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would gut the Antiquities Act, the law first used to protect half of our national parks. The Antiquities Act has been used by 16 presidents of both parties to protect many of America’s most special places, from the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon to the Pacific Remote Islands in Hawaii. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 47-48 (Senate roll call vote 10). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Lands/Forests
Energy Efficiency,"Senator Al Franken (D-MN) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would establish a national energy efficiency resource standard based on successful programs in Minnesota that require electricity and natural gas providers to meet annual targets for cutting energy use in homes and businesses. Energy efficiency saves consumers money while reducing the public health and environmental risks of pollution. This amendment would also send a clear market signal that would spur research and development of energy efficient technologies. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Franken amendment by a vote of 43-52 (Senate roll call vote 11). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Clean Energy
Fast Tracking Natural Gas Pipelines,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would set strict, arbitrary deadlines for the review of natural gas pipelines on federal and tribal lands. This amendment undermines the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by promoting accelerated construction of pipelines and other components of natural gas production at the cost of the environmental reviews that NEPA established to identify serious safety and environmental risks. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Barrasso amendment by a vote of 52-43 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 12). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"
Limiting Public Safeguards,"Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would require federal agencies to eliminate a public protection with equal or greater compliance costs before adopting a new one. The Sullivan amendment adopts an extreme and unwise “cut-go” approach to rulemaking, drastically limiting the government’s ability to quickly respond to emerging public health threats and catastrophes like the drinking water crisis that unfolded in Flint, Michigan. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Sullivan amendment by a vote of 49-46 (Senate roll call vote 13). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Taxpayer Handouts for Fossil Fuel Companies,"Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would phase out fossil fuel subsidies for coal and some of the largest producers of oil and gas over a four-year period, the same time period over which Congress recently decided to phase out tax credits for solar and wind. The fossil fuel subsidies phased out by this amendment represent billions of dollars of taxpayer handouts for a mature and highly-polluting industry. On February 2, the Senate rejected the Schatz amendment by a vote of 45-50 (Senate roll call vote 14). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Dirty Energy
Genetically Modified Food Labeling,"Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) introduced S. 2609, a bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, also known as the Denying Americans the Right to Know (DARK) Act, which would prevent states from requiring the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In addition, the bill would make it harder for companies to inform customers about their ingredients, strip the Food and Drug Administration of its jurisdiction over GMO food disclosures, and force the USDA to spend resources promoting biotechnology to consumers. The majority of people in the United States increasingly want to know more about where their food comes from, not less. But instead, this bill’s sweeping preemption of state and local authority is an attack on consumer choice and state efforts to protect human health and the environment. Senator Roberts’ bill was added to S. 764, but on March 16, the Senate rejected the DARK Act by a vote of 48-49 (Senate roll call vote 37). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. S. 764 was later amended and passed by both chambers and signed into law by President Obama on July 29.",Toxics/Public Right to Know
Encouraging Energy-Efficient Homes,"Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would reform the mortgage market to incentivize energy efficiency by ensuring that energy costs are included in the underwriting process. More efficient homes save money for homeowners while reducing carbon pollution. On April 19, the Senate approved the Isakson amendment by a vote of 66-31 (Senate roll call vote 49). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. S. 2012 passed the Senate and moved to conference with a House-passed energy bill, but did not become law.",Clean Energy
Land & Water Conservation Fund (LWCF),"Senator James Lankford (R-OK) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would divert money away from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) in order to address maintenance projects in our national parks. This amendment would restrict spending from LWCF’s statutorily-directed purpose in order to address the National Park Service’s deferred maintenance backlog. On April 19, the Senate rejected the Lankford amendment by a vote of 34-63 (Senate roll call vote 50). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Lands/Forests
Wind Energy Transmission Line,"Senator John Boozman (R-AR) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would require additional studies before proceeding with the construction of a 700-mile electricity transmission project that would bring wind energy from the Great Plains to the southeast. The project, known as the Plains and Eastern Clean Line project, would provide much-needed transmission capacity to our outdated grid and has already been approved under a process created by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. On April 19, the Senate rejected the Boozman amendment by a vote of 42-55 (Senate roll call vote 51). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Clean Energy
Victory Bonds for Clean Energy,"Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) offered an amendment to S. 2012, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015, which would require the secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan to issue Clean Energy Victory Bonds. These bonds would aim to raise as much as $50 billion and would be used to finance clean energy projects, including wind, solar, advanced vehicles, and fuel cells. Rapid deployment of clean energy technology is the best way to fight climate change. On April 19, the Senate rejected the Udall amendment by a vote of 50-47 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 52). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Clean Energy
Attack on the Clean Water Rule,"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) offered an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which would prohibit the use of funds for implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule, which protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of 117 million people in the United States.

Water Conservation Program,"Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) offered an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which would create a pilot program for water conservation in the Colorado River system. With climate change fueling droughts across the western United States, a new approach to water use in the Colorado basin is badly needed. On April 26, the Senate approved the Reid amendment by a vote of 73-23 (Senate roll call vote 62). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. H.R. 2028 was signed into law by President Obama on December 10.","Water, Climate Change"
Mitigating Impacts on Fish and Wildlife,"Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) offered an amendment to H.R. 2028, the Further Continuing and Security Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017, which would require the Secretary of the Army to use federal and state expertise to mitigate the fish and wildlife impacts of the Army Corps of Engineers’ projects. This amendment clarifies requirements in the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 to ensure that federal agencies give full consideration to wildlife impact analyses from the Fish and Wildlife Service and state agencies. On May 11, the Senate rejected the Cardin amendment by a vote of 39-60 (Senate roll call vote 69). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Wildlife
Revenue Sharing for Offshore Drilling,"Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) sponsored S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016, which would expand revenue sharing from offshore drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, which creates incentives for additional offshore drilling that damages our climate and coastal communities, businesses, and ecosystems. Offshore drilling inevitably leads to oil spills, which puts at risk coastal communities’ robust tourism and commercial and recreational fishing industries, as well as critically important wildlife, while impeding America’s transition to clean energy. Revenue sharing also siphons revenues away from the Treasury and directs them to a handful of states at a time when we are struggling to address our nation’s fiscal challenges. On November 17, the Senate rejected a motion to end debate and proceed to S. 3110 by a vote of 51-47 (60 votes were needed to end debate; Senate roll call vote 153). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Oceans"
Limiting Access to the Courts,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would have a chilling effect on citizen enforcement of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), one of American’s most effective and important environmental laws that serves as a safety net for wildlife, fish and plants on the brink of extinction. By subjecting ESA lawsuits to the Equal Access to Justice Act’s below-market cap on legal fees, this amendment would make it more difficult for citizens from across the political spectrum to obtain counsel and challenge illegal government actions. On January 21, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 54-45 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 7). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Attack on Clean Air Protections,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would exempt power plant units that burn ""coal refuse"" or waste from complying with certain clean air and public health protections required under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Cross State Air Pollution Rule and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Communities living downwind from these plants would suffer negative health consequences, ranging from asthma attacks to premature deaths, were these clean air exemptions to become law.

Climate Change Science,"Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which expresses the sense of Congress that climate change is real and that man-made pollution is a significant contributor to climate change. 2014 and 2015 were the two hottest years on record, and this amendment references the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other scientific institutions. On January 21, the Senate rejected the Schatz amendment by a vote of 50-49 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 12). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL VOTE.",Climate Change
Prioritizing Drilling on Public Lands,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would expedite the applications to drill on America’s public lands and would limit the amount of public input in the decision-making process. Oil and gas companies now have more access to America’s public lands than they currently use and it makes no sense to limit public engagement.

Forcing Tar Sands Polluters to Pay for Spills,"Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would close a tax code loophole that exempts tar sands producers from paying into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Without this fix, taxpayers are on the hook to pay for tar sands spill clean-ups like the ongoing $1.2 billion effort in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

International Climate Action,"Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which undermines the United States’ ability to encourage other countries to address climate change and would be a significant setback in the global fight against climate change. The Blunt amendment seeks to undermine the November 2014 U.S.-China announcement that demonstrated both countries’ commitment to tackling this challenge and builds momentum toward a global solution to the climate crisis.

Prairie-Chicken Protections,"Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would delist the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The Moran amendment subverts the science-based process the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses to determine the population viability of various species and removes protections deemed necessary for the prairie chicken’s survival. On January 28, the Senate rejected the Moran amendment by a vote of 54-44 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 35). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Wildlife
National Monuments,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) offered an amendment to S.1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act, which would express the sense of Congress that national monument designations on federal lands should require approval by the governor and state legislature. Although non-binding, this amendment undermines the intent of the Antiquities Act of 1906, a law that 16 presidents of both parties have used to move swiftly in the face of threats and protect some of America’s most treasured places like the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty.

Keystone XL would lead to a significant expansion of tar sands development, unleashing massive amounts of carbon pollution and threatening surrounding communities, ecosystems, and watersheds including the Ogallala aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions of Americans. Despite these threats, Keystone XL would create just 35 permanent jobs and would not enhance American energy independence.

The Cotton amendment would require the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to examine the “cumulative” economic effects of a critical habitat designation, such as the effect on agriculture and business. The FWS already evaluates the total federal costs of a critical habitat designation and this amendment would drain agency resources that could be better used to further protections for wildlife and plants.

Fast Track of Trade Agreements,"Representative Patrick Meehan (R-PA) sponsored H.R. 1314, the Trade Act of 2015, which approves “fast track” trade promotion authority for international trade agreements. Fast track allows the administration to send already-signed international trade deals to Congress for an up or down vote with limited debate and no amendments, severely hampering Congress’ ability to ensure these agreements benefit communities and protect our environment. Given the scope of these massive agreements and their implications on environmental policies and protections around the world, Congress and the American public have a right to know what is in these deals before negotiations are finished. However, the fast track process established in H.R. 1314 severely lacks both accountability and transparency and does not result in the “race to the top” that is necessary to make real, enforceable progress on environmental and public health issues in these agreements. On May 22, the Senate passed H.R.1314 by a vote of 62-37 (Senate roll call vote 193). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed fast track authority into law on June 29.",Other
Climate Change Science Education,"Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) offered an amendment to S. 1177, the Every Child Achieves Act of 2015, which would establish a K-12 climate change education grant program. Participating states would compete for grants in order to create climate change science and solutions curriculum, teacher trainings, and to achieve sustainable building standards. On July 15, the Senate rejected the Markey amendment by a vote of 44-53 (Senate roll call vote 238). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Gutting Clean Water Protections,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) sponsored S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, a radical assault on the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule, which protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of one in three Americans. S. 1140 would block implementation of the current Clean Water Rule and would require the agencies to re-propose another rule, forcing them to go back to the drawing board, repeating processes and soliciting input that they have already received, a waste of time and taxpayer money. In addition, this bill would also severely narrow and undermine the Clean Water Act itself by arbitrarily defining which waterways deserve protection without any basis in science or recognition of the important role of headwaters and seasonal and rain-dependent waters on downstream water quality. On November 3, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to S. 1140 by a vote of 57-41 (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 295). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Water
Extreme Assault on Clean Water Rule (CRA),"Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sponsored S.J. Res. 22, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval,” which would void the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Clean Water Rule that protects the small streams and wetlands that feed into the drinking water of 117 million Americans. Not only would this obscure and radical measure vacate the current rule, it would also prohibit the agencies from developing any “substantially similar” rule in the future, keeping the unworkable status quo in place leaving our streams, wetlands, lakes, and rivers vulnerable to pollution for generations to come. On November 4, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 22 by a vote of 53-44 (Senate roll call vote 297). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama vetoed S.J. Res. 22 on January 20, 2016.",Water
Extreme Attack on Carbon Pollution Limits for Existing Power Plants (CRA),"Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) sponsored S.J. Res. 24, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” that would permanently block the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan. The Clean Power Plan established the first national limits on carbon pollution from existing power plants—our nation's single largest source of the pollution fueling climate change. S.J. Res. 24 is an extreme measure that would block the biggest step our country has ever taken to address climate change, threatening our health and our future. S.J. Res. 24 would also prohibit the EPA from ever developing “substantially similar” standards in the future. On November 17, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 24 by a vote of 52-46 (Senate roll call vote 306). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Following its passage in the House, President Obama vetoed S.J. Res. 24 on December 18.",Climate Change
Extreme Attack on Carbon Pollution Limits for New Power Plants (CRA),"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) sponsored S.J. Res. 23, the Congressional Review Act “Resolution of Disapproval” that would block the Environmental Protection Agency’s carbon pollution standards for new and modified power plants. S.J. Res. 23 is an extreme measure would permanently block these clean air protections, putting our health at risk and slowing our country's transition to an economy powered by clean energy. On November 17, the Senate approved S.J. Res. 23 by a vote of 52-46 (Senate roll call vote 307). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Following its passage in the House, President Obama vetoed S.J.

Undermining Flood Insurance Reform,"Representative Michael Grimm (R-NY) sponsored H.R. 3370, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which would repeal and delay key provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. Artificially discounted flood insurance rates have led to the development and destruction of floodplains. By undermining steps to increase flood insurance premiums to market-based levels, H.R. 3370 would encourage further floodplain development and lead to the destruction of wetlands, forests, and other habitats that help mitigate flood damage, which will only be made worse by climate change. On March 13, the Senate passed H.R. 3370 by a vote of 72-22 (Senate roll call vote 78). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed H.R. 3370 into law on March 21.",Climate Change
Clean Energy Tax Credits,"Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) offered a substitute amendment to H.R. 3474, the Hire More Heroes Act of 2014, which would extend dozens of tax incentives, including vital clean energy tax credits. The package of tax extenders, known collectively as the Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency (EXPIRE) Act, would extend several energy efficiency incentives and the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which is particularly critical to the continued growth of wind energy. Clean energy tax credits like the PTC have a proven track record of increasing investment, decreasing costs, creating jobs, and reducing pollution. On May 15, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to the EXPIRE Act by a vote of 53-40 (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 157).YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed a shorter-term tax extenders package that included the PTC into law on December 19; however, this only extended tax credits through the end of 2014.",Clean Energy
Environmental Review in Transportation Rebuilding,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) offered an amendment to H.R. 5021, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014, which would exempt the post-disaster rebuilding of transportation infrastructure that was closed for safety reasons from any environmental reviews, approvals, licensing, or permitting. In doing so, the amendment would threaten the environment and public health and roll back bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act, even though these laws already provide flexibility and waivers for emergency situations. On July 29, the Senate rejected the Toomey amendment by a vote of 47-50 (Senate roll call vote 247). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Air, Water"
Democracy for All Constitutional Amendment,"Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) sponsored S.J. Res. 19, an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relating to contributions and expenditures intended to affect elections. This resolution would be a historic step toward reducing the influence of big corporations and other special interest polluters in our elections and restoring the voice of the American people. While amendments to the Constitution are of serious consequence and should not be taken lightly, the dramatic increase of money in politics since the disastrous Citizens United U.S. Supreme Court decision has allowed special interests to spend unlimited amounts of money to protect their ability to pollute our air and water. On September 11, the Senate rejected the motion to end debate and proceed to S.J. Res. 19 by a vote of 54-42. (60 votes were needed to invoke cloture; Senate roll call vote 261). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Other
Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline (KXL),"Senators John Hoeven (R-ND) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA) sponsored S. 2280, a bill to automatically approve the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, which would transport the world’s dirtiest oil through the American heartland to an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast where it would be exported. Keystone XL would lead to a significant expansion of tar sands development, unleashing massive amounts of carbon pollution and threatening surrounding communities, ecosystems, and watersheds including the Ogallala aquifer, which provides drinking water for millions of Americans. Despite these threats, Keystone XL would create just 35 permanent jobs and would not enhance American energy independence. S.2280 would short circuit the federal approval process, eliminating the State Department’s ability to assess whether the pipeline is in the national interest and the President’s authority to ultimately approve or reject the project. On November 18, the Senate rejected S. 2280 by a vote of 59-41 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 280). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy"
Disaster Relief for Hurricane Sandy,"Following its passage in the House, the Senate took up H.R. 152, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, which would provide much needed support for communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy. H.R. 152 included funding to repair national parks and historical treasures as well as many provisions to assess the vulnerability of coastal communities to future disasters and to encourage better pre-disaster planning in a changing climate. On January 28, the Senate approved H.R. 152 by a vote of 62-36 (Senate roll call vote 4). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. President Obama signed H.R. 152 into law on January 29.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife, Climate Change, Other"
Military Investments in Advanced Biofuels,"Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) sponsored an amendment to H.R. 933, the Department of Defense (DOD), Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, which would strip $60 million in funding for advanced biofuels from the DOD budget. The amendment sought to reassign funding for advanced drop-in biofuel production to cover other military operations and expenses.  The DOD is the single largest energy user in the nation, and investing in these renewable fuels significantly reduces pollution and the military’s carbon footprint.  Advanced biofuels also enhance American energy security by giving the military more fuel options and loosening its dependence on foreign oil. On March 20, the Senate rejected the Toomey amendment by a vote of 40-59 (Senate roll call vote 41). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Clean Energy, Dirty Energy"
Big Oil Budget,"Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which was intended to force a vote on House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) alternative House budget resolution. The Ryan budget would make drastic cuts that would jeopardize the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department, Energy Department and other agencies to fulfill their mission to protect our health, safeguard our natural resources, and grow clean energy. While slashing investments that protect our air, water, and open spaces, the Ryan budget would continue billions of dollars in subsidies to the oil industry and lower Big Oil’s tax bill even further by reducing corporate income tax rates. It would also support construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, which would transfer the world’s dirtiest and most carbon-polluting oil through the American heartland to be exported at an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast. On March 21, the Senate rejected the Ryan budget by a vote of 40-59 (Senate roll call vote 46). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. ",Other
Pricing Carbon Pollution,"Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which would prevent Congress from enacting legislation that would place a federal tax or fee on carbon emissions. This amendment would limit Congress’s ability to address climate change, which poses a severe threat to our economy, health, and environment, and would rule out a promising source of revenue for the government. On March 22, the Senate rejected—by a vote of 53-46—a procedural motion that would allow a vote on the Blunt amendment (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 59). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline (KXL),"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) sponsored a non-binding Sense of the Senate amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which would support the approval and construction of the harmful Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. The Keystone XL pipeline would transfer the world’s dirtiest and most carbon-polluting oil through the American heartland to be exported at an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast. The pipeline would threaten our waterways and agricultural lands with oil spills and dramatically worsen climate change, while doing nothing to increase America’s energy security. On March 22, the Senate approved the Hoeven amendment by a vote of 62-37 (Senate roll call vote 61). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The non-binding amendment went no further and a final decision is expected from President Obama in 2014.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy, Water"
Toxic Air Pollution from Power Plants,"Senator Dan Coats (R-IN) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which sought to weaken the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by making it easier for power plants to win an exemption from the requirements. When implemented, these clean air safeguards will save tens of thousands of lives and prevent hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks. While the Coats amendment purports to simply ensure that power plants have the necessary time to meet the standards, it would undermine public health protections. The EPA and the states already have the authority to grant additional time for power plants to install pollution control equipment and the EPA has made clear that more time is also available in order to maintain electric grid reliability. On March 22, the Senate rejected the Coats amendment by a vote of 46-53 (Senate roll call vote 72). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Air
Climate Change Safeguards,"Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) sponsored an amendment to S. Con. Res. 8, the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution, which would enact indiscriminate funding cuts that would prevent federal agencies from curbing greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. As health experts and scientists have extensively documented, carbon pollution and other greenhouse gases threaten public health by causing more heat waves and intense smog, spreading infectious diseases, and bringing about stronger storms, floods, and hurricanes. On March 22, the Senate rejected the Inhofe amendment by a vote of 47-52 (Senate roll call vote 76). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Climate Change
Jewell Confirmation (DOI),"After she was nominated by President Barack Obama, the Senate considered the nomination of Sally Jewell to serve as Secretary of the Interior. As the former CEO of the outdoor recreation retail company REI, Jewell has a unique appreciation for public lands and conservation, and knows firsthand how important it is to protect lands that Americans enjoy for recreational activities like hiking, hunting, fishing, and camping. Throughout her career, Jewell has displayed the ability to skillfully manage a large and successful organization while also working to strengthen Americans’ connection to the outdoors. During her confirmation hearing, she further laid out her vision for a balanced and responsible approach to managing our public lands. On April 10, the Senate approved Jewell’s nomination by a vote of 87-11 (Senate roll call vote 94). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
National Endowment for the Oceans,"Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) sponsored an amendment to S. 601, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, which would establish a National Endowment for the Oceans (NEO) to improve ocean health and support coastal economies. Following the recommendations of the bi-partisan U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy appointed by President George W. Bush, the NEO would support efforts to conserve and restore ocean resources through grants to states, regional and tribal entities, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions. It would also help ensure the sustainable management of our oceans through increased research, monitoring, and observation data. On May 8, the Senate approved the Whitehouse amendment by a vote of 67-32 (roll call vote 116). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. As of this writing, the Whitehouse amendment is under consideration as part of the Water Resources Development Act conference committee. ",Oceans
Clean Water Protections,"Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) offered an amendment to S. 601, the Water Resources Development Act of 2013, which would threaten waters Americans depend on for drinking, swimming, and fishing. The amendment would bar the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from restoring longstanding Clean Water Act protections to critical streams and wetlands across the nation. It would prohibit the Army Corps and EPA from limiting pollution in waterways that supply public drinking water for 117 million Americans and block efforts to protect wetlands that are critical for flood protection. On May 14, the Senate rejected the Barrasso amendment by a vote of 52-44 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 119). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Water
Advancing Conservation in the Farm Bill,"Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) sponsored S. 954, the Senate Farm Bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013, which would enact important conservation practices to protect soil, wetlands, and wildlife. The bill included a historic agreement between agriculture organizations and environmental groups on conservation compliance, requiring farmers to comply with basic soil and water conservation measures in order to receive taxpayer-funded premium subsidies for crop insurance. It also included a national Sodsaver provision that would protect native wildlife habitat and clean water supplies by discouraging farmers from converting America's prairies and grasslands into cropland. On June 10, the Senate approved S. 954 by a vote of 66-27 (Senate roll call vote 145). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. As of this writing, the House and Senate Farm Bills are in conference committee.","Water, Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
Border Fence,"Senator John Thune (R-SD) offered an amendment to S. 744, the Senate Immigration Bill titled the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which would unnecessarily mandate the construction of hundreds of additional miles of destructive double layered walls along the Southwest border. Additional border walls would lead to more damaging floods by impeding the natural flow of water, and would further fragment habitat, jeopardizing imperiled species like jaguars, ocelots, and big horn sheep. Moreover, reports by the Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office have failed to find any evidence that the existing border wall has made a significant contribution to border security. On June 18, the Senate rejected the Thune amendment by a vote of 39-54 (Senate roll call vote 151). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
McCarthy Confirmation (EPA),"After holding up her confirmation vote for over 100 days and Senate Republicans flooding her with over 1,000 questions, the Senate considered President Barack Obama’s nomination of Gina McCarthy to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). McCarthy is extremely well qualified to lead the EPA, and has been widely praised as a proven problem solver who has worked with members of both political parties, industry leaders, and environmental advocates to develop a balanced, sensible approach to protecting public health and the environment. She has worked for both Republicans and Democrats, serving under five Republican governors, including Governor Mitt Romney as his energy and climate adviser in Massachusetts. Since 2009, McCarthy has led the Clean Air division of the EPA, where she has made extraordinary progress protecting our air quality. On July 18, the Senate approved McCarthy’s nomination by a vote of 59-40 (Senate roll call vote 180). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Air, Water"
Offshore Drilling,"Senator David Vitter (R-LA) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would put virtually every U.S. coastline at risk by expanding offshore drilling with no consideration of environmental impacts. The amendment would cut the public out of the review process and reinstate President Bush's 2010-2015 five year leasing plan, which even Bush administration officials said lacked important environmental safeguards and required additional vetting. This drilling expansion could harm billion-dollar coastal industries and undermine military activities in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia and would fail to accomplish the amendment's purported goal of raising significant revenue for roads and bridges. It would also fail to reduce the price at the pump since oil prices are set on a global market. On March 8, the Senate rejected the Vitter amendment by a vote of 43-55 (Senate roll call vote 28). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Drilling, Dirty Energy"
Toxic Pollution from Industrial Boilers,"Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would roll back Environmental Protection Agency safeguards to reduce toxic air pollution, such as mercury, lead, and particulates, from industrial boilers and incinerators. The amendment would gut the Clean Air Act and lead to tens of thousands of premature deaths, over 17,000 heart attacks, and more than 180,000 asthma attacks. Toxic pollution from industrial boilers is also known to cause developmental problems in children. On March 8, the Senate rejected the Collins amendment by a vote of 52-46 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 30). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Air
Gulf Coast Restoration & Land and Water Conservation Fund,"Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would amount to the largest increase in funding for restoration and conservation in a generation. The amendment included the RESTORE Act, legislation ensuring that penalties paid by BP and others responsible for the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill are used to rebuild and restore Gulf Coast communities and habitats. It would also fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at a record level of $700 million a year for two years. On March 8, the Senate approved the Nelson amendment by a vote of 76-22 (Senate roll call vote 32). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The RESTORE Act was included-while unfortunately the LWCF funding provision was not-in the compromise transportation bill (H.R. 4348, MAP-21), which President Obama signed into law on July 6.","Lands/Forests, Oceans, Water"
Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline (KXL),"Senator John Hoeven (R-ND) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would lead to the construction of the dangerous Keystone XL tar sands pipeline-a project to transport the world's dirtiest and most carbon-polluting oil 2,000 miles from the boreal forests of Canada across America's heartland to an international shipping port on the Gulf Coast in order to export it. The amendment irresponsibly asserted that no additional safety or environmental analysis of the pipeline was necessary to ensure the protection of Americans' land, air, water, and health, despite Obama administration findings to the contrary, and the fact that no route for the pipeline existed. On March 8, the Senate rejected the Hoeven amendment by a vote of 56-42 (60 votes were needed for passage; Senate roll call vote 34). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy, Water"
Arctic Refuge & Offshore Drilling & KXL,"Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee Ranking Member Pat Roberts (R-KS) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would threaten communities on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts with new offshore drilling, allow oil and gas drilling in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, open millions of acres of public lands to oil shale and tar sands leasing, and authorize the immediate construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline despite significant safety and environmental concerns. In addition to causing immense environmental damage, the oil and gas leasing required by the amendment would fail to achieve its purported goal of raising the revenues necessary to fund the new transportation infrastructure included in the bill. On March 13, the Senate rejected the Roberts amendment by a vote of 41-57 (Senate roll call vote 38). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Climate Change, Dirty Energy, Drilling, Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
Clean Energy Tax Incentives,"Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) offered an amendment to S. 1813, the Senate transportation bill titled the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which would extend critical incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency aimed at creating clean energy jobs and reducing America's dependence on foreign oil. The amendment would extend several incentives that are particularly important to the wind industry, including the Production and Investment Tax Credits, the Section 1603 Treasury Department Program, and the Section 48C Manufacturing Tax Credit. It would further extend the efficient existing and new homes tax credit and the efficient appliances tax credit. Although the package also included some incentives for harmful fuels, including coal-to-liquids that threaten the environment and exacerbate global warming, it was, on balance, an important step forward for the nation's clean energy economy. On March 13, the Senate rejected the Stabenow amendment by a vote of 49-49 (Senate roll call vote 39). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. Many of the energy incentives included in the Stabenow amendment were extended until the end of 2013 as part of H.R. 8, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, legislation to address the ""fiscal cliff,"" which President Obama signed into law on January 2, 2013.",Clean Energy

Oil Subsidies & Clean Energy Incentives,"Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) sponsored S. 2204, the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act, which would close tax loopholes for the nation's largest oil companies and direct the savings toward investments in clean energy, energy efficiency, and deficit reduction. Massive oil companies reported profits of nearly $1 trillion during the past decade and $90 billion in just the first nine months of 2012 alone, so they have no need for taxpayer handouts. Ending these wasteful subsidies would also stop the practice of subsidizing a dangerous product that is fueling climate change and polluting our air, water, and land. Using some of these savings, the bill would extend for an additional year tax incentives for electric vehicles, cellulosic biofuels, energy-efficient homes and appliances, and numerous forms of clean energy. The remaining savings from repealing Big Oil's subsidies - nearly $11 billion - would be put towards reducing the deficit. Although it would also support harmful fuels like coal-to-liquids, S. 2204 would, on balance, represent a critical move away from dirty fossil fuels in favor of cleaner forms of energy. On March 29, the Senate rejected a motion to curtail debate and pass S. 2204 by a vote of 51-47 (60 votes were needed for the motion to pass; Senate roll call vote 63). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Clean Energy"
Genetically Engineered Salmon,"Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) offered an amendment to S. 3187, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which would ensure that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a definitive decision-making role in the process for approving genetically engineered marine and anadromous fish, including genetically engineered farmed salmon. As a food safety agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) simply does not have the requisite experience or staff expertise to fully evaluate the potential environmental and economic risks that could result from the approval of genetically engineered fish. NOAA, the federal agency charged with protecting the nation's oceans and its vital fisheries, is better suited to properly assess these issues, and giving NOAA a clear role in the approval process is sound and commonsense policy. On May 24, the Senate rejected the Murkowski amendment by a vote of 46-50 (Senate roll call vote 106). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. On July 9, President Obama signed S. 3187 into law, which unfortunately did not include the Murkowski amendment.","Wildlife, Oceans, Other"
Toxic Air Pollution from Power Plants,"Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Ranking Member James Inhofe (R-OK) sponsored S.J. Res. 37, a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval, which would void the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard for power plants, thus threatening the lives and health of thousands of Americans. Mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard is a long overdue public health safeguard that, for the first time, sets national limits on harmful air toxins that are emitted from oil- and coal-burning power plants, including mercury, acid gases, lead, and arsenic. Power plants are the single largest U.S. source of mercury pollution, which is especially dangerous to children and expectant mothers. Once fully implemented in 2016, the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard would prevent up to 11,000 premature deaths, thousands of heart attacks, and over 100,000 asthma attacks each year. The CRA resolution is a radical legislative tool that would undo these protections and prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from ever taking similar steps in the future to protect communities from this harmful power plant pollution. On June 20, the Senate rejected the Inhofe CRA resolution by a vote of 46-53 (Senate roll call vote 139). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Air
Conservation on Private Farmlands,"Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) offered an amendment to S. 3240, the Senate farm bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, which would repeal the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Conservation Reserve Program. Together, these two programs reward agricultural producers who help conserve critical natural resources on more than 75 million acres of farm and ranch land in the United States. These programs not only are very popular with farmers, but also have a proven track record of providing valuable taxpayer benefits by improving soil, water, and wildlife habitat. On June 20, the Senate rejected the Lee amendment by a vote of 15-84 (Senate roll call vote 148). NO IS THE PROENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Conservation Compliance,"Senator Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) offered an amendment to S. 3240, the Senate Farm Bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, which would reattach basic soil and water conservation measures to premium subsidies for crop insurance, restoring longstanding requirements that those who receive subsidies take some minimal steps to protect the public good. The amendment would save an estimated $60 million, ensure all farmers have a level playing field with regard to eligibility requirements for subsidies, and help ensure long-term farm productivity by protecting vital natural resources. It would also ensure that taxpayer funds do not subsidize damaging soil erosion that chokes our waterways, increases the cost of water treatment and dredging, and reduces the long-term productivity of farmland. Without the Chambliss amendment, this Farm Bill would allow for the destruction of tens of thousands of acres of valuable wetlands, resulting in increased downstream flooding, loss of wildlife habitat, and decreased water quality. On June 20, the Senate approved the Chambliss amendment by a vote of 52-47 (Senate roll call vote 155). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law a broader legislative package averting the year-end ""fiscal cliff"" that included an extension of the 2008 Farm Bill through September 30, 2013; however, the Chambliss amendment was not part of the extension.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Industrial Farm Clean Water Violations,"Senator Mike Johanns (R-NE) offered an amendment to S. 3240, the Senate Farm Bill titled the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from efficiently and effectively monitoring for Clean Water Act violations at industrial-scale livestock operations via aircraft. This tool is primarily used to observe large animal feeding operations, where manure spills into water bodies are easily identifiable from the air. These flyover inspections are conducted in small planes and have been done for nearly a decade as a cost-effective alternative to on-site inspections, and Congress does not restrict how the EPA monitors any other industries. The EPA has a responsibility under the law to monitor for this kind of pollution and should not be prohibited from doing so through a reliable means that saves significant taxpayer dollars.

Military Investments in Alternative Fuels,"Senator Mark Udall (D-CO) offered an amendment to S. 3254, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which would restore the military's ability to invest in alternative fuels. Shifting from fossil fuels to alternatives like advanced biofuels reduces the military's carbon footprint and reduces pollution, while giving the military more fuel options and loosening its dependence on foreign oil. Investing in advanced biofuels could also enhance national and economic security by keeping military energy spending down and reducing exposure to oil price shocks. On November 28, the Senate approved the Udall amendment by a vote of 62-37 (Senate roll call vote 206). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.

Sweeping Environmental Funding and Policy Assault,"H.R. 1, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011, which at the time it passed the House was the greatest legislative assault ever on the environment and public health, including massive funding cuts and policy assaults on our air, water, wildlife and wild places. On February 19, the House passed H.R. 1 (House roll call vote 147).  On March 9, the Senate rejected H.R. 1 by a vote of 44-56 (Senate roll call vote 36).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The Obama administration and Senate leadership subsequently stood strong in negotiations with the House and insisted that most--but not all--of the anti-environmental riders from H.R. 1 be dropped before agreeing to the final compromise bill, H.R. 1473, which the president signed into law on April 15.","Air, Clean Energy, Climate Change, Water, Wildlife"
Global Warming Pollution,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) offered an amendment to S. 493, small business reauthorization legislation officially titled the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011, to repeal the scientific finding by the EPA that greenhouse gases endanger human health and the environment, to permanently block the EPA from reducing greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, and to undermine fuel economy standards.  This radical amendment would jeopardize public health and the environment, and increase our dangerous dependence on oil.  On April 6, the Senate rejected three other anti-environmental amendments--sponsored by Senators Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Max Baucus (D-MT)--to weaken or delay the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act and then proceeded to reject the McConnell amendment by a vote of 50-50 (Senate roll call vote 54).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  On April 7, the House passed H.R. 910, which is identical to the McConnell amendment (House roll call vote 249).  At the end of 2011, the EPA's ability to reduce greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act remained firmly intact.",Climate Change
Oil Subsidies,"Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) sponsored S. 940, the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, which would close tax loopholes for oil companies, since their outsized profits make it clear that they do not need taxpayer handouts. At a time when our fiscal situation is prompting cuts to critical programs, including environmental and clean energy investments, our government should not be subsidizing massive oil companies that reported profits of nearly $1 trillion during the past decade. On May 17, the Senate failed to achieve the 60-vote threshold needed to pass a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 940. The motion failed on a 52-48 vote (Senate roll call vote 72).

Offshore Drilling,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) introduced S. 953, the deceptively titled Offshore Production and Safety Act of 2011, which would expand offshore drilling and make it more dangerous by enacting oversight standards that are weaker than those in place before the catastrophic 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which tragically killed eleven workers, wreaked havoc on Gulf coast businesses in the fishing and tourism industries, and damaged coastal and marine ecosystems.  The bill would mandate numerous lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off Virginia's beaches, requiring the government to use outdated and inadequate environmental reviews in the processing of new leases, even though the reviews do not consider the impacts of a worst-case scenario like the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The bill would also impose a rushed and arbitrary time period of just 30 days for the Interior Secretary to approve or deny drilling permits, and it would grant automatic approval if no action is taken within 60 days.  On May 18, the Senate rejected a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 953 by a vote of 42-57 (Senate roll call vote 73).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Regulatory Rollbacks,"Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) offered this amendment to S. 782, the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011, which would have severely undermined the regulatory process.  This amendment would create several unnecessary new processes to complicate economic analyses of proposed rules and to ensure interagency consultation that is already conducted by the Office of Management and Budget.  It would also require a lengthy periodic review process for rules at select agencies, including the EPA, and impose mandatory budget cuts if reviews are not conducted or are incomplete.  Furthermore, this biased review process would look at rules' costs but not their benefits--including the environmental, health, food safety and other important benefits--which numerous third party analyses have found far outweigh their costs.  On June 9, the Senate--in a 53-46 vote--failed to achieve the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Snowe amendment (Senate roll call vote 87).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The House passed several bills that would severely undermine the regulatory process and jeopardize vital public protections (House roll call votes 880, 888, and 901); however, no such proposals have made it to the President's desk.",Other

Conventional corn ethanol has far-reaching negative environmental impacts, including water pollution, global warming pollution, and habitat destruction, and is already mandated by the Renewable Fuel Standard. On June 16, the Senate adopted the Feinstein-Coburn amendment by a vote of 73-27 (Senate roll call vote 90). YES IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The ethanol tax subsidy and import tariff expired at the end of 2011 and were not renewed by Congress.",Dirty Energy
Gutting Transportation Enhancements,"Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) offered this amendment to H.R. 2112, the FY12 Appropriations bill for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, to defund the Transportation Enhancements program.  This proven program has been the largest source of federal funding for trails, walking, and biking for 20 years, and amounts to less than 2% of overall spending on surface transportation.  Transportation currently accounts for more than two-thirds of our nation's annual oil use and roughly one-third of our global warming emissions, and this small program is critical for giving people access to cleaner transportation choices.  On November 1, the Senate rejected the Paul amendment 38-60 (Senate roll call vote 190).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.",Transportation
Broad Environmental Assault (S.1786),"Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch (R-UT) sponsored S. 1786, the Long-Term Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011, which is a sweeping and extreme assault on our government's ability to protect the public from a wide range of threats, ranging from pollution to workplace safety.  While framed as a transportation bill, this legislation actually includes S. 299, the REINS Act--a radical assault on our system of public protections--as well as a host of provisions undermining specific bedrock public health and environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.  The bill would stop the EPA from cleaning up harmful pollution such as mercury, soot, smog, arsenic, lead, and carbon dioxide from some of our nation's biggest polluters, including power plants, cement plants, and industrial boilers and incinerators.  On November 2, the Senate rejected a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 1786 by a vote of 47-53 (Senate roll call vote 196).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The House has passed numerous pieces of legislation that are part of S. 1786, including H.R. 10--the House version of the REINS Act--on December 7 (House roll call vote 901).","Air, Climate Change, Other"
Cross-State Air Pollution,"Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) sponsored S.J. Res. 27, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to void the Cross-State Air Pollution rule, which will save lives and improve public health for millions of Americans. The Cross-State rule, which was finalized in July 2011, reduces dangerous smog and soot-forming pollution that is emitted from power plants and travels across state lines, and is estimated to save up to 34,000 lives and to prevent 400,000 asthma attacks, 15,000 heart attacks, and 1.8 million missed days at school or work each year, among other health benefits. On November 10, the Senate rejected S.J. Res 27 by a vote of 41-56 (Senate roll call vote 201). NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE. The House had previously passed legislation on September 23 to block the Cross-State rule as part of the TRAIN Act (House roll call vote 741). There were no further legislative attempts to block the Cross-State rule in 2011, but the D.C. Circuit Court temporarily stayed the Cross-State rule on December 30.",Air
Broad Environmental Assault (S. 1720),"Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member John McCain (R-AZ) sponsored S. 1720, the so-called Jobs Through Growth Act, an extreme assault on our government's ability to protect the environment and public health.  While framed as a jobs bill, this legislation would prevent the EPA from cleaning up harmful pollution from some of the nation's biggest polluters, reduce oversight for drilling, open our precious public lands to harmful tar sands development by private companies, and prohibit California from ensuring that enough water is allocated to protect salmon and Delta smelt.  On November 10, the Senate rejected S. 1720 by a vote of 40-56 (Senate roll call vote 202).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.","Air, Dirty Energy, Drilling, Water, Wildlife"
Undermining Critical Environmental Programs,"Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch (R-UT) introduced S.J. Res. 10, legislation to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget every year, and to limit spending to 18% of U.S. gross domestic product.  This legislation's draconian spending cap would undercut the federal government's abilities to meet its core commitments, including protecting our air, water, wildlife, and lands.  Independent economic analysts projected catastrophic consequences if a balanced budget amendment were already in place for FY12.  On December 14, the Senate rejected this resolution by a vote of 47-53 (Senate roll call vote 229).  NO IS THE PRO-ENVIRONMENT VOTE.  The House voted on a series of balanced budget amendments; however, no such proposals made it to the President's desk.",Other
Border Fence Construction,"Nearly one-third of the 1,950 mile United States-Mexico border lies within military, tribal, and public lands, including wilderness areas, national wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests, national monuments, and state parks. Much of this country's most magnificent and imperiled wildlife -- including jaguars, ocelot, bighorn sheep, Sonoran pronghorn, and hundreds of bird species -- depend upon these public lands for intact habitat.

Lead Paint Protections,"Exposure to lead is linked to a range of human health impacts, from behavioral problems and learning disabilities to seizures and death. Children under the age of six are most at risk. To improve public health, the EPA now requires that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in pre-1978 homes, child care facilities, and schools be certified to do so by the EPA. They also must use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices.

These subsidies dwarf the incentives that are currently available for renewable energy and energy efficiency and distort the market in favor of this mature industry that is a major source of global warming and other toxic pollutants. President Obama called for the elimination of many of these subsidies in his budgets for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 and agreed to eliminate these subsidies in a pledge made with other world leaders at a Group of 20 Summit in 2009. Congress, however, has not taken the steps necessary to end these subsidies.","Drilling, Clean Energy, Dirty Energy"
Biodiesel Tax Credit,"A tax credit for biodiesel was created in 2004 as part of the JOBS Act, which provided $1.00 to the fuel blenders for each gallon of biodiesel blended into petroleum diesel. The credit expired at the end of 2009. Since the creation of this tax credit, the environmental benefit of biodiesel has been called into question as expanded soybean and other biodiesel feedstock production has contributed to the destruction of natural ecosystems and increased agricultural inputs. The credit is considered a driver of biodiesel production in the United States, resulting in environmental damage worldwide. For example, biodiesel produced from soybeans in the United States results in a significant amount of land use change internationally, and expanded soybean production is a primary factor in the deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"

Clean energy and energy efficiency received significant support in the economic recovery package of 2009, which boosted these critical industries at a time of economic crisis. Unfortunately, the 111th Congress failed to enact additional policies that would further unleash the job-creation potential of these industries, either in the form of a comprehensive clean energy and global warming bill or a federal Renewable Electricity Standard. However, as the Congress drew to a close, senators were presented with a unique opportunity to invest in these industries.",Clean Energy

Yet the Reagan Administration proposed to lease as much coal in 15 months as previous administrations has leased in 63 years. From an environmental standpoint, they chose some of the worst possible tracts. Some were next to National Parks. Others would have violated the Clean Air Act, or would have diverted and polluted scarce water resources.

The military use of commercial nuclear power plants would give the nuclear industry another subsidy and a ""national security"" rationale. It would also mean that several million cubic feet of nuclear wastes could be transported from power plant to bomb plant via trucks on U.S. highways. The spent nuclear fuel rods would then be converted into a liquid form which is more unstable and more dangerous. Until now, the U.S. commercial nuclear program has always been carefully kept separate from the military. The Hart amendment intended to keep it that way.

The Cannon amendment said that a state objection would prevail unless both the House and the Senate voted to override it, thus strengthening the hand of local residents who are most deeply affected by a siting decision. No safe and permanent way to dispose of nuclear wastes has yet been found. The federal government has repeatedly tried to locate disposal sites in places whose safety was questionable, only to back off when public resistance increased.

America is losing 5 billion tons of topsoil a year, more than we did during the dustbowl. A General Accounting Office survey found that 84% of farmers were losing more than 5 tons per acre and were hurting long range productivity. Many have abandoned traditional soil conservation practices. The plowing of fragile lands in the West can also hurt adjacent unplowed lands because of dust and wind erosion. It is silly for the government to promote soil conservation on the one hand, and erosion on the other. Given the size of farm surpluses, we do not need to subsidize farming on fragile land. Amendment adopted 69-29; September 28, 1982. YES is the pro-environmental vote. The Armstrong amendment was dropped in the House-Senate conference, and not included in the final bill which passed Congress.","Lands/Forests, Toxics/Public Right to Know"
Moratorium on Federal Coal Lease Sales,"The vote is on the Bumpers (D-AR) amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill (H.R. 7356), to delete $2.13 million from the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in order to delay two scheduled western coal lease sales. Though directly affecting only these two sales, this was in effect a confidence vote on Interior Secretary Watt's energy leasing policies. A few days before, the House removed money for the sales, pending a Congressional investigation of whether BLM had been mismanaging coal lease sales and failing to get a fair market value for its coal. In the largest coal lease sale in history, BLM sold 8 of 11 leases without competitive bids, and received only 25% of what comparable coal had sold for in private sales two years earlier.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"
Highway Construction,"The vote is on the Tsongas (D-MA) amendment to the Transportation Assistance Act (H.R. 6211), better known as the gas tax bill. The amendment would have transferred $16 billion away from new Interstate highway construction and spent it instead on repair of existing highways and bridges. The only new Interstates affected by the amendment were those that the U.S. Department of Transportation said were not ""essential to the completion of an interconnected Interstate highway system."" Most of these are proposed urban commuter routes which are strongly opposed by local environmentalists, such as Westway in New York City. These commuter highways increase air pollution and energy consumption, and in some cases destroy important wildlife habitat.",Transportation
Clinch River Nuclear Breeder Reactor,"The vote is on the Appropriations Committee Amendment to the fiscal 1983 Continuing Resolution (H.J. Res. 631), to put back money for the Clinch River breeder reactor which had been removed by the House. For years environmentalists have fought against this nuclear breeder reactor, which would produce massive quantities of plutonium, one of the most toxic substances there is. Unlike the byproducts of existing nuclear reactors, plutonium can easily be made into nuclear weapons by terrorists or foreign nations. Commercialization of breeder technology inevitably puts the ingredients of nuclear bombs into every day commerce, blurring the line between nuclear power and nuclear weapons.","Dirty Energy, Toxics/Public Right to Know"
Nomination of James Watt to be Secretary of Interior,"After the President, the Secretary of Interior has more power than anyone else in government over the nation's public lands and natural resources. The Secretary of Interior is steward over a quarter of the nation's land area, and 300 million acres on the outer-continental shelf. The Secretary is required by many laws to carefully balance the grazing, timber and mining interests with fish and wildlife conservation, watershed protection, wilderness and recreational needs.",Other
Funding for Mass Transit and Low-Income Home Insulation,"Chafee (R-RI) amendment to the Budget Reconciliation bill to restore $500 million for public transportation and $100 million to help poor people insulate their homes. The amendment also added money for numerous other social programs for fiscal year 1982 and 1983. Of the many good programs cut by Congress this year, public transportation suffered some of the most severe cuts. The Senate Budget Committee slashed $3.2 billion from the transit budget, a 30% cut from previously authorized levels.","Clean Energy, Transportation"
Water Projects Funding,"Metzenbaum (D-OH) and Heinz (R-PA) amendment to the fiscal year 1982 Budget targets to reduce funding for water projects by $300 million. In a year when an unprecedented $30 billion was cut from social programs, the Reagan Administration left the budget for water projects virtually intact, recommending only a $40 million or 2% cut in the $2.16 billion program. This amendment would have reduced the water project budget by an additional $300 million, a modest 7% reduction compared to most other budget cuts.","Water, Wildlife, Lands/Forests"
Nuclear Basing Mode,"Tower (R-TX) motion to table (kill) the Levin (D-MI) - Kassenbaum (R-KS) amendment to the fiscal 1982 Defense Authorization bill to require advance approval of both houses of Congress before the funds in the bill could be spent on a basing mode for the MX Missile. This vote was taken before President Reagan cancelled the multiple protective shelter basing mode for the MX missile. To protect against a Soviet nuclear strike, the Air Force wanted to put more than 200 MX missiles in valleys in Nevada and Utah. Each missile would move continually between 4,600 shelters and 23 potential launch sites, so the Soviets would not know their exact location at any one time. This shell game is called the basing mode, and would affect 25,000 square miles of land, much of it de facto wilderness. Local ranchers and environmentalists, as well as several national environmental groups, opposed this method of basing the missiles because it meant massive withdrawals of land, boom towns, a staggering drain on the area's water resources and an end to traditional rural lifestyles. The missiles will be almost impossible to hide unless the whole area is off limits to the public. The missiles can be used as offensive first strike weapons. The shell game basing mode could have cost $50 billion, excluding the production costs of the missile itself, money that would not then be available either for social programs or for more sensible defense programs. Motion agreed to 59-39; May 13, 1981. NO is the pro-environmental vote.",Lands/Forests
Nomination of John Crowell to be Assistant Secretary of Agriculture,"This Assistant Secretary is responsible for the U.S. Forest Service, which manages 190 million acres of National Forest in 44 states. Much of that land contains timber, oil, gas and minerals, as well as watershed, wilderness and wildlife habitat. The Assistant Secretary will play a key role in determining the development status of some 60 million acres of unspoiled forest whose fate has not yet been decided.",Other
Solar Energy Budgeting,"Bumpers (D-AR) - Hart (D-CO) amendment to the Budget Reconciliation bill to increase the budget for solar energy research and development, energy conservation, and the Solar Energy & Conservation Bank by $450 million. Under pressure from the Reagan Administration, the Senate Budget Committee had cut conservation by 30% and the Solar and Conservation Bank by 60% below the original Carter Budget for 1982. This amendment attempted to more fairly balance the subsidies which the government extends to nearly all energy sources. In the long run, conservation and renewable sources are the safest and cheapest energy programs. Unlike other energy sources, they do not pollute and never run out. They are inflation-resistant; once the initial investment is made no further fuel costs are required. Through greater reliance on conservation and renewable resources, the U.S. could reduce its energy consumption by a third over the next 20 years, save $300 billion in fuel costs, and forgo the construction of 700 new nuclear or coal-fired electrical generating plants, without any difference in American productivity or lifestyle. The amendment was rejected 35-63; June 24, 1981; YES is the pro-environmental vote.",Clean Energy
Nuclear Research and Development,"Kennedy (D-MA) amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Act to reduce the nuclear fission research and development budget by $309 million. Despite the massive cuts that Congress and the Administration made in nearly all non-military programs in 1981, funding for nuclear research and development was substantially increased. The Senate rejected this amendment to eliminate a 41% increase in nuclear R & D funding the day after it voted huge cuts in solar and energy conservation (see vote 11). Despite a 26-year, multi-billion dollar investment by the federal government, nuclear power remains extremely dangerous and expensive, with no end in sight to its escalating costs. It is ironic that many politicians who speak the loudest in favor of free market economics voted to increase federal handouts for the most heavily subsidized segment of the energy industry. Rejected 25-69; June 25, 1981. YES is the pro-environment vote.",Dirty Energy
Motorcycle Noise Standards,"Kasten (R-WI) amendment to the Noise Control Authorization bill to keep federal authority to preempt state noise control standards for new motorcycles. Federal law prevents states from setting noise standards where comparable federal standards exist. The Kasten amendment would have prevented states from setting standards for the manufacture and sale of motorcycles, even though there will be no such federal standards until 1983, and all federal funding to enforce the standards has been eliminated. The Harley Davidson Company whose advertising slogan is ""Make Your Own Thunder"" pushed this amendment largely to avoid compliance with California noise standards, which are stricter than the federal standards would be. Motorcycles are one of the greatest sources of noise pollution in America, and evidence is growing that excessive noise is not only a nuisance, but a danger to physical and environmental well-being.",Other
Home Energy Conservation,"Dole (R-KS) amendment to the fiscal year 1982 Interior Appropriations bill to cut $7 million for the Residential Conservation Service. This program requires large gas companies and electric utilities to conduct residential energy audits on request to help customers learn how to conserve energy in their homes. While very little federal funding is required to support this service, the Department of Energy estimates that in the first five years, the program could stimulate $15 billion in weatherization investments, and ultimately reduce energy consumption by $30 billion. Rejected 17-71; October 26, 1981. NO is the pro-environment vote.",Clean Energy
Low-Income Home Insulation,"Mitchell (D-ME) - Cohen (R-ME) amendment to fiscal year 1982 Interior Appropriations bill to add $27.5 million for energy conservation and weatherization of low-income homes. The $42 million cut in aid to low income families for home weatherization is one of the best examples of ""penny wise, pound foolish"" budget cuts adopted by the Senate this year. While spending nearly $2 billion to help poor people pay their fuel bills, the Senate rejected this much more modest effort to help them insulate their homes. According to the Department of Energy, a $1,000 weatherization investment reduces home heating costs by an average of 25% per year. It pays for itself in just a few years, while reducing oil imports. But many low-income Americans cannot afford the capital investment to insulate, and the poor do not benefit from the 15% tax credit as middle and upper income families do. Rejected 46-49; October 27, 1981. YES is the pro-environment vote.",Clean Energy
Solvent Refined Coal Funding,"Proxmire (D-WI) - Nickles (R-OK) amendment to the fiscal year 1982 Interior Appropriations bill to remove $130 million for a solvent refined coal demonstration plant in Newman, Kentucky. Solvent refined coal (SRC-1) is a chemical process that turns coal into solid coke and liquid boiler fuel. SRC-1 would release toxic chemicals into the air and water, and could violate federal health regulations and expose on-site workers to high cancer risks. For many of the plant's exotic by-products and wastes, air quality standards and emission limits ""do not as yet exist,"" the plant's environmental impact statement said. SRC-1 will consume tremendous amounts of water and pour potentially toxic metals into the Green River, sometimes causing significant deterioration in water quality.","Dirty Energy, Toxics/Public Right to Know"
Interior Funding,"Mattingly (R-GA) amendment to make a 5% cut of $380 million in the fiscal 1982 Appropriations for the Department of Interior, Forest Service, and some Department of Energy programs. The Interior Department would have been most affected by the cut, and its 1982 budget was already $353 million below 1981 levels. Environmentalists supported most (though not all) of the programs in the bill, which included the Land and Water Conservation Fund (used to buy parkland, wildlife refuges and national forests), the operating budgets for the National Park Service and Fish & Wildlife Service, the Youth Conservation Corps, historic preservation, and the Solar and Conservation Bank. Rejected 35-61; October 27, 1981. NO is the pro-environment vote.",Other
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway,"Percy (R-IL) - Moynihan (D-NY) amendment to the fiscal year 1982 Energy and Water Development Appropriations to remove $189 million for the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. This ""three billion dollar ditch"" is the most expensive and perhaps most controversial project ever undertaken by the Corps of Engineers. The cost of the project has shot up tenfold since construction began, and stopping it now would save taxpayers an estimated $1.6 billion.","Water, Wildlife, Lands/Forests, Transportation"
Clinch River Nuclear Breeder Reactor,"Johnston (D-LA) motion to kill the Bumpers (D-AR) - Humphrey (R-NH) amendment to the Energy & Water Development Appropriations bill to reduce by half the money for the Clinch River nuclear breeder reactor. This meant a cut of $90 million. Breeder reactors produce more nuclear fuel than they consume, but they are more expensive and much more dangerous than the light water reactors now in use. They require the production and shipping of large amounts of plutonium, one of the most poisonous substances known. Terrorists or other nations would need only a small amount of plutonium to make a nuclear bomb. The core of the breeder generates tremendous heat and is usually cooled with liquid sodium, which is itself dangerous and can explode or burn on contact with either air or water.","Dirty Energy, Toxics/Public Right to Know"
Funding for EPA and CEQ,Garn (R-UT) motion to table (kill) the Hart (D-CO) amendment to the fiscal year 1982 Continuing Appropriations.

Mine Safety,"Byrd (D-WV) - Specter (R-PA) amendment to exempt the Mine Safety and Health Administration from the 4% funding cut in the fiscal year 1982 Continuing Appropriations Resolution. Funding cuts in the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) have proven so disastrous that the Reagan Administration is now asking that $2 million be added back in the 1982 and $15 million in 1983. Reagan changed his mind because of the public outcry after 153 miners were killed in 1981 (the highest total since 1975) and 20 were killed in January 1982 alone (compared to 9 the year before). Fewer mine inspectors have been issuing fewer violation notices, closing fewer mines for safety, and collecting less in fines. The amendment would have restored $6 million for MSHA. Environmentalists support a safe and healthy workplace environment. We cannot in good conscience continue to support deep mining as an alternative to strip mining unless we work to improve conditions in the deep mines. Rejected 38-54; December 11, 1981. YES is the pro-environment vote.",Other
Water Project Budget,"S. Con. Res. 86. The vote is on the Bellmon amendment to kill the Cohen amendment, which would have reduced the fiscal 1981 budget for water projects by $500 million. This brought before the Senate an important question of priorities. At a time when many other federal programs were being cut, shouldn't the pork barrel water projects like those above be cut back too? If adopted, the amendment would have forced the Appropriations Committee to cut back funding for the Tennessee-Tombigbee and other projects. The Carter Administration took no position on the amendment. May 7, 1980. Passed 54-40. NO was the correct vote.",Water
Pollution Control Regulations,"S. Con. Res. 86. Fiscal 1981 Budget Targets. This vote is on the Chiles amendment to prohibit agencies from publishing any new regulations that could increase costs or prices, unless these increases were offset by a reduction in other regulations elsewhere. While this may sound reasonable on the face of it, in fact it would make it extremely difficult for federal agencies to write any new regulations at all. There is no mechanism in government, nor did the amendment create any mechanism, for getting one agency to reduce or abandon its own regulations in order to oblige some other agency that needs to impose new regulations. How would the Environmental Protection Agency respond to an emergency like the widespread dumping of chemical wastes if this amendment became law? The Carter Administration opposed the Chiles amendment. May 7, 1980. Adopted 53-34. NO is the correct vote.",Other
Clean Air,"S. 2470. Coal Conversion bill. The vote is on the Johnston motion to kill the Tsongas amendment, which would have assured that utilities not increase air pollution when they shifted from oil to coal as a fuel. Coal is a much dirtier fuel than oil, and the amendment would have required the use of scrubbers or other equipment to control the extra emissions. Without these controls, a massive shift from oil to coal could result in a 25% increase in sulfur dioxides, a 33% increase in nitrogen oxides, and a 16% increase in acid rain in the Northeast, and could have erased much or all of the progress made in cleaning up the region's air since 1970. Acid rain from coal fired plants in Ohio has already wiped out fish in Adirondack lakes many hundreds of miles away, and is also suspected of hurting crop productivity. The Tsongas amendment would have allowed the shift to greater coal use without sacrificing clean air. The Carter Administration supported the motion to kill the Tsongas amendment. June 24, 1980. Passed 63-31. NO was the correct vote.",Air
Garrison Diversion,"H.R. 7542. Supplemental Appropriations. The vote is on the Johnston amendment to table and thus kill the Pressler amendment to stop any of the money from being used for any part of the Garrison Diversion project that would affect South Dakota. The Garrison project involves building a vast network of canals in North Dakota that would cause pollution and runoff in both Canada and South Dakota. It would violate U.S. - Canadian treaties and destroy almost 220,000 acres in order to irrigate another 250,000 acres of farmland that is already productive. It would also destroy many North Dakota wetlands and eight wildlife refuges used heavily by waterbirds. The Administration did not support the amendment. June 27, 1980. Passed 62-26. NO is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
Alaska Lands I,"H.R. 39. This bill determined the fate of the last great wilderness in North America. The Senate Energy Committee reported a bill far weaker than the House bill, and conservationists tried to strengthen it on the Senate floor. The vote is on the Jackson amendment to table (and thus kill) the Hart-Chafee amendment, which would have protected an additional 14.5 million acres as national wildlife refuges. These areas included an expanded Arctic National Wildlife Range, which is vital habitat for Alaska's largest remaining Caribou herd, and protection of the Yukon Flats marshes, one of the most important nesting areas in North America for migratory water birds. The Carter administration supported the amendment and opposed this motion to kill it. July 22, 1980. Rejected 33-64. NO was the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
Alaska Lands IV,"H.R. 39. The vote is on the Melcher amendment to the Hart-Chafee amendment, which would have turned some of the national wildlife refuges into National Forest lands instead. This would open up the land to multiple use, including mining and commercial logging, rather than managing it for wildlife. The area in question is the winter range for the Porcupine caribou herd (largest in Alaska) and thus vital to the herd's survival. The Administration opposed Melcher. July 22, 1980. Rejected 30-66. NO is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
Alaska Lands II,"H.R. 39. When they lost the above vote, opponents of the bill tried a halfway measure. This vote is on the Jackson-Hatfield substitute to the Hart-Chafee amendment described above. It would have added only 7 million acres rather than 14.5 million. Parts of the above areas were restored, but other important wildlife habitat was still excluded. The Administration opposed this substitute. July 22, 1980. Rejected 33-62. NO is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
Workplace Environment,"H.R. 3904. The vote is on the Boren amendment to exempt small businesses with lower than average illness and injury rates from routine inspections by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Without inspections, there is no guarantee that good safety records will be maintained. Environmentalists and unions argued that a worker's right to a safe environment should not depend on the size of the company he works for. OSHA has been working to ease the burden on small business by eliminating its more petty requirements and concentrating on severe health hazards like toxic chemicals. But it needs the authority to make occasional inspections even of small companies as a deterrent to make sure they remain safety-conscious. The Administration opposed the Boren amendment. July 29, 1980. Passed 48-36. NO was the correct vote.",Other
Nuclear Waste,"S. 2189. The vote is on the Johnston motion to kill the Hart amendment to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which would have restricted the use of federal Away-From-Reactor (AFR) storage sites for spent nuclear fuel. The amendment would have limited Away-From-Reactor storage to those cases where it was absolutely necessary because the utilities no longer had any space left at their own nuclear sites. The amendment would have reduced the risk of nuclear accidents caused by the long distance transportation of dangerous nuclear wastes to a few centralized facilities. Environmentalists also viewed a broad Away-From-Reactor storage program as a subsidy to the nuclear industry, which could then wash its hands of the problem and make government responsible for paying all the costs of storing the nuclear wastes. Nor would the AFR program have significantly improved safety precautions, because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was already overseeing the handling of nuclear wastes at private facilities. The Carter Administration sent confusing messages about the Hart amendment, with the White House saying one thing and the Department of Energy another. July 30, 1980. Amendment killed 51-44. NO was the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Alaska Lands III,"H.R. 39. The vote is on the Byrd cloture amendment to stop a filibuster by Senator Gravel so that the Senate could vote on a compromise Alaska Lands bill. After several victories by conservationists, Senate leaders took the Energy Committee's bill off the floor to improve it and work out a compromise. But it was necessary to close off debate to allow even this compromise to pass. The Administration supported this motion. August 18, 1980. Passed 63-25. YES is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Wildlife"
Strip Mining III,"H.R. 1197. The vote is on the Bumpers amendment to the above bill, to require that strip mine operators re-vegetate and restore prime agricultural land and make sure it is once again productive for growing crops before they can get back their performance bonds. In the past, rich topsoil has often been destroyed and land that is important to the nation's food supply has been made worthless. Conservationists joined farmers in lobbying hard for this amendment.

Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway,"H.R. 7590. Energy and Water Appropriations. The vote is on the Chafee amendment to remove $200 million that was to be spent on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. This is a proposed 450 mile barge canal connecting the Tennessee and Tombigbee Rivers. It is known as the ""$3 billion ditch"" because the costs of the project keep rising and now exceed $3 billion. The environmental impacts are devastating. It would destroy over 100,000 acres of farmland, forests and wildlife habitat. The Army Corps of Engineers is trying to claim benefits for the project that do not exist, because the area already has an extensive rail system to move freight and the nearby Mississippi River is used for barge traffic. The project would involve using more earth than was used to build the Panama Canal. The Administration opposed the amendment to cut funding. September 10, 1980. Rejected 37-52. YES is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
Nuclear Proliferation,"H. Con. Res. 432. The vote was on the adoption of a Resolution to overturn President Carter's decision to ship 38 tons of enriched uranium fuel to India. The fuel would be used in India's Tarapur nuclear reactors, which have reprocessing facilities and could use it to produce plutonium. India has refused to accept international safeguards for her nuclear facilities and will not allow other nations to inspect the Tarapur reactors. Nor will she sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission had earlier voted 5-0 to oppose the shipment, saying that it was a violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act because the grace period given earlier to India to change its policies had expired. Senator Glenn who led this effort in the Senate said that the shipment would destroy U.S. credibility in its efforts to persuade other nations to cooperate in stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Carter Administration opposed the Resolution. September 24, 1980. Rejected 46-48. YES is the correct vote.","Dirty Energy, Other"
Nuclear Power,"S. 562. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Authorizations. The vote is on the Hart-Kennedy amendment to impose a six month moratorium on the granting of any new construction permits for building nuclear power plants, starting in January 1980. The vote occurred not long after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island showed the inadequacy of safety precautions, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's enforcement, the lack of evacuation plans, and the whole power plant licensing process. This amendment would have given the Kemeny Commission some time to investigate the accident, and given the Administration some time to implement its recommendations when they came out, before it resumed licensing of nuclear power plants. The Administration opposed the amendment. July 17, 1979. Rejected 35-57. YES is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Dickey-Lincoln Dam,"H.R. 4388. The vote is on the Cohen amendment to remove funding for the Dickey-Lincoln dam in Maine, which would ruin the St. John river, the biggest wild river left in the Northeast. The area would also flood out more than 86,000 acres of valuable commercial timberland, and superb big game habitat. The project would be used to generate extra power for the peak demand for electricity in New England. But this problem could be solved more easily through peak power pricing and better energy conservation in buildings. The Corps used phony recreational benefits and artificially low interest rates to justify this project economically. The Administration did not support the amendment. July 17, 1979. Rejected 46-51.

Endangered Species: Tellico Dam II,"H.R. 4388. The vote is on an earlier Culver amendment to remove House language which exempted the Tellico Dam form the Endangered Species Act and all other federal laws. The language had been slipped into the House bill with no discussion, despite the controversial nature of the issue. In addition to being economically wasteful, the Tellico Dam will drive hundreds of small farmers off their lands. A government committee set up to resolve conflicts between projects and endangered species had sided with the snail darter, because the dam had so little to recommend it.

This would have shifted the burden of proof from the polluter to the regulatory agency. History has shown that regulations to control pollution and toxic substances are extremely difficult to enforce, and this amendment would have made enforcement even more difficult.

Endangered Species: Tellico Dam I,"H.R. 4388. Energy and Water Appropriations. The vote is on the Johnston motion to accept the House language which exempted the Tellico Dam project in Tennessee from the Endangered Species Act and from all other federal laws. This was the last in a series of battles to save the Little Tennessee River valley from being flooded by the Tellico Dam, which a General Accounting Office study had said was economically wasteful because its costs were greater than its benefits. The dam had been stopped in the courts because it destroyed the only remaining habitat of an endangered species, the snail darter.

Strip Mining I,"S. 1403. This vote is on final passage of Senator Byrd's bill to gut the national strip mine Act. The bill would have delayed protections on federal lands and compliance deadlines under the 1977 Act. But by far the most damaging provision would have exempted state governments from having to obey the tough regulations written by the Office of Surface Mining. Instead the state programs need only conform to the law itself. This would have made it difficult if not impossible to get uniform, timely enforcement of the law. The federal regulations have already been tested in court, and won. Under this amendment each of the 24 state programs would have to be challenged in a different court within that state, perhaps with different results. Historically the enforcement of state strip mining laws has been very weak, and without a strong federal role the state programs set up under this bill would also be weak.

Acre Limitations,"S. 14. The bill raises the limits in the 1902 Reclamation Act, which says that federally subsidized irrigation water can be provided only to small farmers. The limits were raised from 160 to 1280 acres. The vote is on the Hatfield motion to kill the Cranston amendment, which would have allowed big agribusiness corporations to lease unlimited amounts of water and still enjoy subsidies for their first 1,280 acres, provided they pay full cost for any extra water. This would legitimize the widespread abuse of the Reclamation Act, which was originally intended to help family farmers. Many environmentalists would like to help small farmers compete with agribusiness, believing that resident farmers have more respect for their land. Agribusiness companies are now using cheap federal water to grow rice and other water-intensive crops in semi-arid regions of the West, when these crops could be grown more easily in the East, Midwest and South without wasting so much water and without creating political pressure to build more dams. The Carter Administration opposed the Cranston amendment and supported this motion to kill it. September 14, 1979. Passed 42-33. YES is the correct vote.",Water
Energy Conservation II,"S. 1398. The vote is on final passage of the Industrial Energy Efficiency Act, to encourage industries to purchase more energy-efficient equipment, and to require mandatory energy efficiency standards if these voluntary measures failed. Industrial motors and pumps consume about 15% of all electricity in the U.S. and for the past 15 years there has been a general decline in their efficiency. But much more efficient pumps and motors are now available on the market, which could save us about 189,000 barrels of oil a day by 1985 -- roughly the output of seven nuclear power plants.

Energy Mobilization Board I,"S. 1308. The vote is on the Johnston motion to table the Muskie-Ribicoff substitute to limit the powers of the Energy Mobilization Board (EMB). The bill reported by the Senate Energy Committee gave this board the power to exempt big energy projects from future environmental laws, and to take over the decision-making powers of state, local and federal agencies if they did not meet the EMB deadlines for deciding whether to give a permit to an energy project. The Muskie-Ribicoff substitute would have sped up decision making without giving the Board such sweeping powers, and directed EMB to use the courts to enforce its deadlines for decisions. Conservationists lobbied hard against giving a few presidential appointees the power to ride roughshod over health and environmental laws they had fought for decades to put in place.

This would mean that a President like Ronald Reagan could in effect abolish whatever environmental laws he didn't like, without having to go through Congress. The Carter Administration opposed the Huddleston amendment. October 3, 1979. Rejected 37-56. No is the correct vote.",Other
Synthetic Fuels II,"H.R. 4930. The vote is on whether Senator Byrd's amendment to set up an Energy Security Reserve and give it $20 billion to spend on synthetic fuels development was germane and could be added to an Appropriations bill. This kind of crash program to develop synthetic fuels would be environmentally devastating. It would require huge amounts of scarce Western water and could end up leaching toxic substances into groundwater. It also means extensive strip mining, and would put more carbon dioxide into the global atmosphere than would comparable amounts of other fossil fuels, thus possibly altering the earth's climate. The fuels would not be commercially available for ten years and would cost at least $38 a barrel. The Carter Administration supported this program. October 15, 1979. Ruled germane 56-34. NO is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Synthetic Fuels I,"S. 932. The vote is on the Proxmire amendment to substitute the Banking Committee's bill for the one reported by the Senate Energy Committee. The Proxmire substitute had a much more modest program for synthetic fossil fuels, costing only $3 to $9 billion instead of $20 billion. Instead, it shifted more money to energy conservation and renewable energy sources, providing over $1 billion for a solar bank to make subsidized loans for home heating, $6 billion for a similar bank to promote energy conservation, and over $4 billion for loan guarantees and grants to encourage the development of alcohol fuels from agricultural products. These amounts were far more generous than those in the Energy Committee version, which gave only peanuts to alternative sources and $20 billion for synthetic fuels from coal. The renewable energy sources in Proxmire's substitute are both cheaper and better for the environment than synthetic fuels from coal. The Administration opposed the Proxmire amendment. November 7, 1979. Rejected 37-57. YES is the correct vote.","Clean Energy, Dirty Energy"
Energy Conservation I,"S. 932. Defense Production Act. The vote is on the Johnston motion to kill the Javits amendment, which would have expanded the energy conservation loan program for buildings. The bill as written limited this program to landlords of buildings with four or fewer units, while the amendment made it available to other landlords too. Well over 50% of all renters are in multi-family dwellings, and it is here than the need for conservation is greatest. Many low income housing units have almost no insulation at all. Studies indicate that we could save the equivalent of at least 3 million barrels of oil a day through a comprehensive program to insulate and conserve energy in buildings. By broadening this program, the amendment would have shifted some of the money in the bill away from subsidies for synthetic fuels development and toward energy conservation, our cheapest and safest energy source. The Carter Administration opposed the Javits amendment and supported this motion to kill it. November 8, 1979. Passed 45-39. NO was the correct vote.",Clean Energy
River of No Return,"S. 2009. This bill set aside as wilderness 2.3 million acres in the Salmon River watershed in central Idaho, a scenic and forested area rich in wildlife. The vote is on the McClure amendment which designated all other National Forest lands in central Idaho as permanent non-wilderness. This would make them off limits for any future wilderness consideration. Environmentalists felt this set a bad precedent for similar legislation in other areas, thus preempting multiple use planning and management by the Forest Service. The Carter Administration opposed the McClure amendment. November 20, 1979. Rejected 21-67. NO is the correct vote.",Lands/Forests
Windfall Profits Tax,"H.R. 3919. The vote is on the Bradley-Chafee amendment to increase the tax rate on oil discovered between 1973 and 1978 from 60% to 75%. This would have increased the windfall profits tax paid by the oil companies by about $22 billion. The money would have been used to ease the burden on poor people who were hardest hit by the decontrol of energy prices, and for energy conservation and the development of new energy sources. The oil companies tried to argue that their taxes should be kept low because increased profits gave them increased motivation to explore and develop new sources of oil. But this tax was on oil already discovered and developed, where profits reaped from decontrol would not result in any additional output. The Administration supported the amendment. December 4, 1979. Passed 58-35. YES is the correct vote.","Clean Energy, Dirty Energy"
Redwood Park Expansion II,"(S 1976). The vote is on the Harakawa amendment to give jurisdiction over compensation for parkland acquisition to the U.S. Court of Claims rather than the federal courts as provided in the bill . The effect of this amendment would be to increase payments to the timber companies for their land, since the U.S. Court of Claims has a poor record on compensation issues and the federal district courts are better able to determine a fair price. Environmentalists opposed the amendment, fearing that parkland acquisition became too costly there would be less money available to purchase other valuable parkland elsewhere. The Administration also opposed the amendment. Rejected 36-57; January 31, 1978. No is the correct vote.",Lands/Forests
Redwood Park Expansion I,"(S 1976). The vote is on the Havakawa amendment to delete from the bill provisions entitling the Secretary of Interior to take over some or all of a 30,000 acre designated zone bordering Redwood National Park, if that becomes necessary to protect the park. The original Redwood Park had been threatened by logging operations outside the park that caused soil erosion and flooding downstream within the park. The Committee bill provided this park protection zone to guard against such problems in the future. Environmentalists supported the Committee bill and opposed the amendment. So did the President. Rejected 28-65; January 31, 1978. No is the correct vote.",Lands/Forests
Water Subsidies,"(HR 8309). The vote is on the Cranston amendment to nullify the Gravel amendment, which would have exempted the Kings River water users In California from the 160 acre limitation imposed on them by law. Environmentalists supported Cranston's effort to enforce the 1902 Federal Reclamation Act which said that federally-subsidized irrigation water could be provided only to small farmers. If this measure were strictly and vigorously enforced. It would break up the powerful agribusiness interests that are now growing rice and other water-intensive crops in semi-arid regions of the West. This would in turn reduce the political and economic pressure for more Bureau of Reclamation projects. Many of the California crops could be grown more easily in the South and East without irrigation and thus without the need for new dams. But eastern farmers can't compete and western farmers get federal water at ridiculously low prices. Pressure to enforce the 160 acre limit will probably drive up water prices and thus encourage water conservation. Many environmentalists would also like to help the small farmer compete successfully with agribusiness, believing that small resident farmers will have more respect for their land. Adopted 52-37; May 2, 1978. Yes is the correct vote.","Water, Lands/Forests"
Mass Transit,"Transportation Appropriations (HR 12933). The vote is on the Lugar amendment to reduce the appropriation for the Urban Mass Transit Administration by $170 million. Environmentalists favor full funding, to encourage the use of mass transit instead of the private automobile. The use of bus and rail transit for commuting reduces air pollution and promotes energy conservation. The Administration opposed the amendment. Rejected 26-44; June 23, 1978. No is the correct vote.",Transportation
Endangered Species Act,"(S 2899). The original Act prohibited any federal project from destroying the last remaining habitat of an endangered species. The vote is on the Stennis amendment to exempt from the Act any federal projects that was begun before the Act passed In 1973, or was now more than 50% complete. The amendment also gave the heads of federal agencies the authority to exempt their own projects. Environmentalists charged that this was like ""putting the fox in charge of the hen house"" and considered Stennis the key weakening amendment to the bill. They would have preferred to see no changes in the Act at all, but accepted the Culver-Baker Committee bill as offering a fair amount of protection for endangered species. The extinction of species has accelerated from one every 100 years in 1600, to one to twenty species lost each year in the 1970s. The Administration opposed the Stennis amendment. Rejected 22-76. July 18, 1978. No is the correct vote.",Wildlife
Endangered Species,"(S 2899). The bill created a seven member Cabinet-level Commission to deal with conflicts between endangered species and projects. An agency with a project in conflict could present its case to this Commission and ask for an exemption. The vote is on the Scott amendment to allow four of the seven members to vote for an exemption from the law, instead of five as provided in the Culver-Baker bill. The Commission was composed of the Secretaries of the Army, Interior, and Agriculture, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Governor of the state in which the project was located. Given the differing views of these agencies, it would have been far more difficult to get five votes for an exemption than to get four. Environmentalists and the Administration opposed the Scott amendment. Rejected 23-69. July 19, 1978. No is the correct vote.",Wildlife
National Environmental Policy Act Exemption,"Department of the Interior Appropriations (HR 12932). The vote is on the Curtis motion to prevent reconsideration of a vote to exempt water projects in the Colorado River Basin from having to prepare a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Western Senators were afraid that the pending NEPA lawsuit would halt construction of some of their pet water projects, which had been evaluated individually, but not collectively with regard to their cumulative impacts. Consideration of these cumulative impacts is badly needed because of increasingly serious salinity problems, the cumulative loss of critical fish and wildlife habitat, and because there is not enough water In the Colorado River Basin to meet the demands of all the projects and uses that are already authorized. The Carter Administration favored a strict application of NEPA and opposed Curtis motion to table. Agreed to 59-33; August 8, 1978. No is the correct vote.","Water, Other"
Coal Roads,"Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1978 (S 3073). The vote is on the Huddleston amendment to authorize an additional $100 million for both fiscal 1979 and 1980, from the Highway Trust Fund, for the rehabilitation of roads damaged by the transportation of ""energy resources"". This funding would be in addition to that already in the highway bill. The amendment would apply mainly to roads used for hauling coal, to repair damages caused by overweight trucks. Thus it was an indirect subsidy to the coal and trucking companies. It is usually more energy-efficient to haul the coal by rail. The Administration opposed the amendment. Rejected 37-51; August 21, 1978. No is the correct vote.","Dirty Energy, Transportation"
Strip Mining II,"(S. 7). The vote is on the Johnston amendment to permit states to retain exclusive jurisdiction over strip mining regulations, if the Secretary of Interior determined that the state's environmental standards were at least as strict as the federal standards. Environmentalists saw this amendment as a way for the states to avoid federal oversight. Past history suggests that once states were granted exclusive jurisdiction, they might be very lax in enforcing their own regulations. Strip mine enforcement in most states has been very weak. Environmentalists opposed this amendment and supported the attempt in S. 7 as written to establish uniform strip mine reclamation standards nationwide. The Administration also opposed the amendment. Rejected 39-51; May 19, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Strip Mining I,"Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (S 7). The vote is on the Hart amendment to ban all strip mining of western alluvial valley floors, unless mining operations had been approved prior to January 4, 1977. This would have plugged a loophole in the bill, which exempted mines which had undergone ""substantial and legal commitments to begin mining."" Alluvial valley floors are the most productive agricultural and cattle raising lands in the West, because they have naturally sub-irrigated and flood irrigated hay meadows. Strip mining here would further deplete scarce western water resources. An EPA study showed that less than 3% of the region's coal lay under alluvial valley floors, and hence environmentalists believe that agriculture should be given greater priority here. The Administration also supported the Hart amendment. Rejected 37-45: May 20, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests, Water"
Strip Mining IV,"(S. 7). The vote is on the Danforth amendment to weaken strip mine reclamation requirements in mountainous areas. The Committee bill required that the land be restored to its ""approximate original contour."" The Danforth amendment gutted this provision and required only that strip mine operators obey federal pollution, health and safety laws, and restore the land sufficiently to meet local land use requirements. Yet state and local land use laws are often very weak, or don't exist at all. This amendment would have allowed strip miners to leave highwalls in some areas because localities claimed they were planning to use the broad ledges underneath them for parking lots. The Administration and the environmentalists opposed the amendment. Rejected 35-46; May 20, 1977. No is the correct vote.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"
Strip Mining III,"(S. 7). The vote is on the Bumpers amendment to delete from the bill a requirement that surface owners must give their written consent before federally owned coal could be mined beneath their land, and to set compensation for damages to surface owners. In the past, the federal government opened up these western lands for homesteading, while retaining rights to the coal underneath. Yet the farmers and ranchers who settled here little dreamed that someday their land might be ruined. The amendment would have protected their rights and probably prevented strip mining in some areas. A National Academy of Science study concluded that most western states did not have enough water to support large scale coal development and that some areas would be impossible to reclaim for agriculture because strip mining would destroy the soil and the aquifers. The environmentalists and the President opposed the amendment. Adopted 44-32; May 20, 1977. No is the correct vote.","Dirty Energy, Lands/Forests"
Flood Plain Development,"Flood Insurance Amendments (S. 1523). The vote is on the Eagleton amendment to once again allow federally-insured banks to make loans for building on flood hazard areas that refused to participate in the federal flood insurance program. The program was designed to discourage irresponsible new floodplain development. It required local communities to map their floodplains, zone against new construction in the most flood prone areas, and adopt other safety measures. The government's main sanction for implementing this program was the restriction on loans that this amendment removes. Without it environmentalists feared that communities would drop out of the program, seek federally-insured financing for new construction and then yell for disaster relief when the floods hit . The amendment prohibited giving relief under such circumstances, but it is neither humane nor politically realistic to expect the government to deny relief to disaster victims. Environmentalists opposed the Eagleton amendment because it encourages floodplain development that paves over the richest farmland, increases flood damage, and creates pressure to build more dams. Adopted 49-36; June 7, 1977. No is the correct vote.","Water, Lands/Forests"
Clean Air Amendments I,"(S 252A). The vote is on the Griffin amendment to delete provisions requiring that the Nitrogen Oxide Standards for auto emissions be reduced to .4 gram per mile by 1983. Instead cars would be allowed to emit up to 1 gram of NOx per mile. Griffin's amendments gutted Senator Hart's amendment, which would have penalized cars that emitted more than .4 grams per mile and rewarded purchasers with rebates if their cars achieved better than the Act's standards for all three pollutants (carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides). Griffin removed these provisions, leaving only a study on the health impact and feasibility of the .4 NOx standard. Environmentalists opposed the Griffin amendment because NOx is already known to be a major source of lung and respiratory disease. The Carter Administration had endorsed the original Committee bill which contained the weaker NOx standard, but did not lobby specifically on the Griffin or Hart amendments. Adopted 51-43. June 8, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Air
Clean Air Amendments III,"(S 252). The vote is on the Stevens amendment to allow state Governors to permit Class I and Class II areas to exceed allowable pollution levels for 18 days a year. This amendment would gut that portion of the Clean Air Act which protects areas with pristine air from Òsignificant deteriorationÓ in air quality. Class I areas are national park and wilderness areas over 5,000 acres; Class II areas include all other areas not violating federal ambient air standards for sulphur dioxide and particulates. Exempting the 18 days of peak pollution would significantly lower air quality. The amendment would allow construction of giant power plants and manufacturing complexes near National Parks. For example, the Inter-Mountain Power Project could have built a 300,000 megawatt coal fired power plant 9 miles from Capitol Reef National Park in Utah under this amendment. Its defeat was a major victory for environmentalists. The Carter Administration opposed the amendment. Rejected 33-61; June 9, 1977. No is the correct vote.","Air, Lands/Forests"
Clean Air Amendments II,"(S 252) The vote is on the Baker substitute to the Riegle-Griffin amendment. The Riegle-Griffin amendment would have substantially weakened protection against auto emissions by delaying the 1 gram per mile NOx standard for two years (from 1980 to 1982) and the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide standards for one year (from 1979 to 1980). Baker's compromise retained the committee's earlier 1 gram NOx standard but accepted the one year delay for HC and CO. It allowed some 1980 and 1981 cars to emit up to 2 grams of NOx if they had innovative engine and emission systems not using precious metals and if they could meet other emission standards. All cars would have to comply with the standards by 1982. Environmentalists supported Baker's amendment. Considering the enormous pressure exerted by the auto industry, the vote in favor of Baker was considered a coup for clean air. The Administration supported the committee bill and opposed the Riegle-Griffin amendment. Adopted 56-38. June 9, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.",Air
Mine Safety,"(S. 717). The vote is on the Schmitt amendment to provide for automatic expiration of each new mine health and safety standard after five years, unless it is renewed by the Secretary of Labor. In other words, one bad Secretary of Labor could gut the bill. Environmentalists support strong health and safety provisions to protect the working environment of the miner. We cannot in good conscience continue to promote deep mining over strip mining unless we improve conditions in the deep mines. Every year about 150 people die in coal mines, while another 25,000 are injured. Environmentalists opposed the Schmitt amendment. Rejected 31-52; June 20, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Mine Safety,"(S. 717). The vote on the McClure amendment to delete provisions authorizing federal inspectors to close down mines cited for repeated violations of safety standards. The power to close the mines is the only really effective enforcement sanction that the government has, and passage of this amendment would have gutted the whole Act. Environmentalists opposed the amendment. The Administration took no known formal position, but probably opposed the amendment informally. Rejected 21-76; June 21, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Waterway User Fees,"(S 1529). The vote is on the Stevenson amendment to authorize construction of a new Lock and Dam 26 to accommodate heavier barge traffic, but without authorizing a user fee system for barges that would benefit. The user fee had been linked to Lock and Dam 26 by Senator Domenici who felt that this was the only way to get a user fee system to pass the Congress. Stevenson's amendment removed his bargaining chip and provided only for an 18 month Department of Transportation study of user fees. The barge companies now use federal waterways for free, even though they are built and maintained at taxpayers' expense by the Army Corps of Engineers. Thus barge companies lobby hard for further canal construction even when it can't be justified economically. Environmentalists support user fees to discourage the needless channelization of natural streams and the resulting destruction of fish and wildlife habitat. They joined the President in opposing Stevenson's amendment. Rejected 44-51; June 22, 1977. No is the correct vote.","Water, Transportation"
Water Projects,"Public Works Appropriations (HR 7553). The vote is on the McIntyre amendment to eliminate the seven water projects remaining on President Carter's hit list that were kept in the Appropriations Committee bill. All these projects were environmentally destructive and fiscally irresponsible. They would inundate prime farmland, scenic valleys and wildlife habitat for alleged flood control or recreational benefits. Some claim inflated benefits from flat-water recreation while destroying the recreational benefits of a free flowing river. Most couldn't be justified economically except through the use of outdated and unrealistic interest races in calculating their cost/benefit ratios,and often they benefit a select few at the expense of a larger group. The President supported the amendment, as did environmentalists. Rejected 34-52; June 30, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.","Water, Lands/Forests"
Nuclear Power,"ERDA  Appropriations (HR 7553). The vote is on the Kennedy amendment to reduce the appropriations for the Barnwell nuclear reprocessing plant from $14 million to $1 million. Senator Hollings had asked for the $14 million to do studies and to keep the people at Barnwell employed. Environmentalists oppose federal funding for Barnwell (now a private facility) because this would facilitate federal takeover to use the plant for reprocessing nuclear fuels and as a massive dumping ground for nuclear wastes. Barnwell is not a good spot for nuclear waste storage because it could contaminate the aquifers under the Savannah River. The Administration initially supported Kennedy but then switched its support to Hollings at the last minute. Environmentalists supported Kennedy. Rejected 22-69: July 11, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Nuclear Breeder Reactor,"ERDA Authorization bill (S 1811). The vote is on the Bumpers amendment to limit spending on the Clinch River breeder reactor to $33 million for project termination costs. The Committee bill contained the full $150 million funding for the breeder, despite Presidential threats of a veto. Senator Church offered an amendment to provide $575 million, enough to keep workers on the site until the reactor was redesigned, but not enough to begin actual construction. The Bumpers amendment was intended to stop the Clinch River breeder completely. It would not have affected breeder research, since $333 million for research was provided elsewhere in the bill. Environmentalists have long opposed the breeder because it produces plutonium, is more dangerous than conventional nuclear reactors, and soaks up money that might otherwise go to alternative energy programs. In lobbying against the Clinch River breeder the President emphasized how plutonium increases the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. The President supported the Bumpers amendment. Rejected 38-49; July 11, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Nuclear Power,"ERDA Authorizations (S 1811). The vote is on the Curtis amendment to delete Title II, which created a new and more costly system for charging electrical utilities for federally provided uranium enrichment services. The government has kept the price of uranium enrichment artificially low in the past. Title II would have raised the price to reflect true costs. Environmentalists supported this change because they opposed federal subsidies for the nuclear industry. Both environmentalists and the Carter Administration opposed the Curtis amendment. Rejected 39-58; July 12, 1977. NO is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Offshore Oil Drilling I,"Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (S. 9). The vote is on the Bartlett amendment to allow the oil companies to withhold their interpretations of exploratory drilling data from the Interior Department, which leases Outer Continental Shelf lands. In the past the Interior Department has purchased the data but lacked the expertise to interpret it fully. Better information would help the Interior Department make more intelligent decisions about where to lease to maximize oil revenue while minimizing the impact on fisheries and on the environment. The Administration opposed the amendment. Rejected 32-54; July 15, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Drilling
Offshore Oil Drilling II,"The vote is on the passage of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (S. 9) which substantially improved the law governing the Interior Department's leasing of the OCS lands for oil drilling. The new law gave the Secretary of the Interior discretionary authority to cancel leases if they would have serious and lasting environmental impacts. The new Act imposed strict liability for oil spill damages, to give the oil companies a strong incentive to be careful, and it required the use of the safest available drilling technology. It set up an Oil Spill Liability Fund and a Fishermens Gear Compensation Fund for immediate compensation to people suffering damages. Coastal states received additional funding to help them cope with the onshore impacts of OCS development, and got greater power to participate in decision-making. The Carter Administration supported the bill and signed it into law. Environmentalists considered it a big step forward in the effort to ensure that offshore energy development does not jeopardize fisheries and coastal resources. Adopted 60-18; July 15, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.",Drilling
Wetlands Protection,"Clean Water Act of 1977 (S 1952). The vote is on the Bentsen amendment to Section 404, to restrict the Army Corps of Engineers' jurisdiction and authority to prevent dredging and filling wetlands, including coastal wetlands. This amendment provided for statutory exemptions for various ranching, forestry, farming and construction activities and for certain Congressionally authorized water projects. It also directed the Corps to transfer most of its authority over wetlands to the state governments. Environmentalists opposed the amendment because very few states have effective wetland protection programs, and over 80% of our swamps and marshes would be left virtually unprotected. Wetlands are vital spawning areas for fish, and provide excellent habitat for wildlife. The Carter Administration opposed the Bentsen amendment. Rejected 45-51; August 4, 1977. No is the correct vote.","Water, Lands/Forests"
Clean Water,"Water Pollution Control Act Amendments (S 1952). The vote is on the Nelson amendment to limit the amounts of phosphates allowed in detergents, dish-washing compounds and water conditioners sold in the eight states adjacent to the Great Lakes. The amendment also directed the Environmental Protection Agency to study the need for a national phosphate control program. Environmentalists supported this amendment since phosphates reduce the levels of oxygen in bodies of water, causing eutrophication and killing fish. The Administration supported the amendment. Adopted 77-17. August 4, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.","Water, Wildlife"
Clean Water Enforcement,"Water Pollution Control Act Amendments (S 1952). The vote is on the Allen amendment to table and thus to kill the Kennedy amendment. The Kennedy amendment would have made the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia the only judicial court to review the national pollution standards and regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency. This would have strengthened EPA's power to enforce pollution laws when challenged in court. Many private industries have learned to manipulate legal technicalities in order to get their court cases heard in certain localities by certain judges who are known to be hostile to environmental regulations. The Kennedy amendment would have ended this tactic, but Allen's motion allowed it to continue. The Administration opposed Allen, as did the environmentalists. Motion to table agreed to 59-36; August 4, 1977. NO is the correct vote.","Water, Other"
Energy Monopolies,"(S. 977). The vote is on the Jackson motion to table and kill the Kennedy amendment to prohibit the major oil and natural gas companies from further acquisition of coal and uranium resources. The Kennedy amendment would not have affected the corporation's current holdings, but would have stopped the trend toward further monopoly control. The major oil companies already control from 35-40% of U.S. coal reserves and also dominate the uranium market. Environmentalists oppose monopoly control by energy conglomerates because it increases their power to control national energy policies. Most big energy corporations have a vested interest in policies that favor synthetic fuels, nuclear power and other destructive, highly centralized energy sources which only they can afford to produce. Environmentalists prefer solar, heat, wind, and other small scale energy sources which lend themselves to competition. The Administration opposed the Kennedy amendment, fearing that it would jeopardize the energy bill in the House-Senate Conference Committee. Environmentalists supported Kennedy and opposed Jackson. Motion to table agreed to 62-30. September 8, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Free Federal Parking,"Energy Conservation Provisions of the National Energy Policy Act (S 2057) The vote is on the Percy amendment to require all federal employees including Congressional staff employees to pay for parking services currently provided free by the federal government. Senators voting against Percy were in effect advocating a policy that encouraged commuting by car. This obviously increases pollution, and is contrary to our national energy goal of reducing gasoline consumption. The vote has symbolic importance since the Senators set an example for the rest of the nation. The Administration did not take a position on the amendment. Rejected 25-56. September 12, 1977. Yes is correct vote.",Transportation
Utility Rate Reform,"(S 2114). The vote is on the Johnston motion to table and thus kill the Brooke amendment to authorize the federal Secretary of Energy to seek judicial review of certain state Public Utility Commission decisions regarding utility rates. Utilities can promote energy conservation by changing their rate structures to flatten out electricity demand throughout the day and removing discounts given to the largest energy consumers. Under this amendment DOE could intervene in court in the name of energy conservation or equity to the consumer. But its appeals would be heard by state courts and governed by state laws. Environmentalists supported the amendment because they want state PUCs to adequately consider all such energy conservation options before supporting new power plant construction. The Administration supported the Brooke amendment. Motion to table agreed to 59-37. October 6, 1977. No is the correct vote.",Clean Energy
Energy Tax Incentives I,"(HR 5263). The vote is on the Jackson amendment to remove from the bill over $30 billion in unnecessary tax credits and subsidies for environmentally destructive forms of energy development. The Jackson amendment would have eliminated four provisions that the Senate Finance Committee had embraced without adequate study and deliberation. It deleted Section 1054 which provided that no energy taxes could be imposed unless the revenues went into an Energy Production, Conversion and Conservation Trust Fund to be used for loan guarantees and other subsidies to the energy companies for development. Jackson called this ""a blank check made out to the big energy producers drawn on the account of the American people."" His amendment also deleted Section 1044, which provided the oil shale tax credit described in vote 30. And Jackson's amendment deleted two provisions in Section 1031, which provided 40% refundable tax credits for nuclear power and for synthetic fuels from coal. Both these technologies have great environmental hazards. The bill's massive subsidies would have put more desirable renewable energy technologies at a severe disadvantage.

Oil Shale,"Energy Tax Incentives provisions of the National Energy Policy Act (HR 5263). The vote is on the Hart amendment to delete from the bill a tax credit of $3 per barrel for oil derived from shale rock. The tax credit would subsidize oil shale projects that were not commercially feasible for private investment, and make them profitable at the public's expense. Oil shale development is destructive to both land and water resources. The processing could cause carcinogens to leach into leaking water, and would leave mountains of tailings for which no good disposal methods have been devised. The Administration did not lobby on this amendment. Environmentalists supported Hart. Rejected 36-47. October 28, 1977. Yes is the correct vote.","Dirty Energy, Drilling"
Energy Tax Incentives II,"(HR  5263). The vote is on the Kennedy motion to table the Allen amendment. Kennedy had just offered an amendment to reduce from 40% to 10% the tax credits allowed to cover the business costs of conversion from oil or natural gas to coal-fired facilities. Allen proposed a compromise of a 20% tax credit, which was shot down by Kennedy on this vote. Environmentalists supported all of Kennedy's efforts to reduce these tax credits, since Treasury Department analysis indicated that the bulk of the money would go to finance nuclear power or synthetic fuels (coal gasification, coal liquefaction, or oil shale). Again, these are destructive and inefficient energy technologies that would consume huge amounts of water, land and investment capital.

Flood Plain Development,"(H.R. 9852) Flood Insurance Amendments: The vote is on the Eagleton amendment to permit banks to finance new construction in floodplain communities that refuse to develop land use controls to prevent flood damage. The amendment would also allow an individual to receive federal flood insurance money even though his community refused to participate in the Flood Insurance Program. This program required communities to map their floodplains, zone against new development in the most flood-prone areas, and adopt other safety measures. Conservationists opposed the Eagleton amendment because it would encourage floodplain development that paves over the richest farmland, increases flood damage, and spurs the government to build more destructive dams and flood control projects. January 23, 1976. Rejected 29-46. The correct vote is no.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Fishing Limits,"(S. 961) The 200 Mile Fishery Zone Limit Act: The vote is on the Muskie amendment to keep important language in the bill that extended U.S. territorial fishing rights from 12 miles to 200 miles off the coast, and allowed the government to set catch limits for species of fish that are severely depleted. Many foreign ships use fine mesh nets and other destructive kinds of fishing gear that kill many more fish than can actually be used. The bill gives U.S. fishermen priority over other nations with the 200 mile zone, and sets up regional counsels with the authority to set catch quotas and regulate fishing techniques. Sen. Cranston tried to gut these provisions, and require instead that the U.S. negotiate for reduced fish catches under a 1958 fishing treaty. But Muskie pointed out that none of the problem nations would abide by the treaty and that all international efforts had ended in failure. Conservationists supported the bill as a necessary first step to protect declining fish populations. January 28, 1976. Adopted 58-37. The correct vote is yes.",Oceans
Glacier Bay Mining,"(S. 2371) Mining in the National Park System Act: The vote is on the Stevens amendment to leave a section of Glacier Bay National Monument open to new mining claims because industry hoped to find additional nickel deposits. The press had publicized the despoliation of Death Valley and five other National Parks and Monuments which had been left open to new mining claims. The Senate bill sought to protect these areas and close them to mining. National Parks are established for the purpose of preservation and not for commercial use. Conservationists have long maintained that mining is incompatible with the purposes of the National Park System. The President took no position but the Interior Department favored the amendment. February 4, 1976. Rejected 33-53. The correct vote is no.",Lands/Forests
Concorde (SST) Landing,"(S. 3015) Airport and Airway Development Act: The vote is on the Weicker amendment to prevent civil supersonic aircraft from landing at U.S. airports by denying them the necessary federal funds to accommodate SST flights or landings. England and France had requested an exemption from U.S. noise standards in order to permit their versions of the SST, the Concorde, to land at airports in New York and Washington D.C. U.S. and environmental agencies opposed this because the planes would produce five times the noise level of the largest subsonic planes and subject thousands of people living around the two airports to unacceptable noise levels. The SST would consume three times as much fuel per passenger mile as the largest commercial jet, yet would carry only one third the number of passengers. The President opposed the amendment. March 25, 1976. Rejected 31-50. The correct vote is yes.",Transportation
Toxic Chemicals,"(S. 3149) The Toxic Substances Control Act: The vote is on passage of the bill, to authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to screen new industrial chemicals before marketing, to require testing of potentially dangerous chemicals, and to ban or restrict the use of chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to the environment. Several thousand new chemicals are introduced into the marketplace each year, and there is currently no warning system to publicize potential dangers before products are widely dispersed. The need for such restrictions had been heightened by the dramatic increase in cancer and by new evidence suggesting that more than 80% of cancer deaths are environmentally related. Passed 60-13. The President opposed the legislation. The correct vote is yes.",Toxics/Public Right to Know
Sewage Treatment Funds,"Public Works Authorizations for Jobs: The vote is on the Muskie amendment to authorize up to to $1.42 billion for construction of waste water treatment plants, plus funds for other state and local services expected to provide jobs. The Administration's budget contained no funds at all for waste water treatment grants to states in fiscal 1977. This meant that states which were already using federal grant money to build sewage treatment facilities would be left hanging for half a year with no money to complete their projects. Environmentalists supported the additional funds. April 13, 1976. Adopted 48-32. The correct vote is yes.",Water
Overgrazing,"(S. 2555) The Rangelands Improvement Act: The vote is on the Cannon amendment to require the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service to grant ranchers 10 year permits for grazing livestock on federal lands, and to require a two year notice before a permit could be cancelled. Ranchers would also be reimbursed for any improvements they made on lands where their permits were terminated. The amendment violates the Multiple Use Act by giving grazers what is in effect an unconditional right to use public lands even when this conflicts with other uses. It would make it extremely difficult for federal officials to cut back grazing if necessary to prevent overgrazing, and to preserve the nation's vast and arid rangelands for wildlife and other uses. The President took no official positions. May 3, 1976. Rejected 40-40. The correct vote is no.",Lands/Forests
Energy Conservation,"(S. 2872) Federal Energy Administration Authorizations. The vote is on the Garn amendment to remove provisions to make federal energy conservation standards for new buildings apply also to state and local building codes. Environmentalists strongly support improved insulation standards to conserve fuel used for heating and cooling buildings. This would result in substantial savings of natural gas and other non-renewable energy sources. The President took no position on the amendment. June 15, 1976. Rejected 45-49. The correct vote is no.",Clean Energy
Synthetic Fuels,"(S. 3105) Authorizations for the Energy Research and Development Administration: The vote is on the Randolph amendment to allow ERDA to push for an expansion of the $900 million loan guarantee program for biomass synthetic fuels as well as projects to demonstrate the commercial potential of other synthetic fuels from coal and oil shale. The effect of this amendment would be to set up a huge Office of Commercialization within ERDA to spend public money to lobby for additional subsidies for coal gasification, coal liquefaction, and oil shale development. Environmentalists strongly opposed federal subsidies for these synthetic fuels because they would severely deplete western water supplies and probably cause extensive strip mining, air pollution and boom town development. Moreover, synthetic fuels are so expensive and destructive that they might end up costing more energy to produce than they will yield when finally burned. June 25, 1976. Adopted 65-15. The correct vote is no.",Dirty Energy
Solid Waste,"(S. 2150) Solid Waste Disposal Authorization: The vote is on the Hatfield amendment to require five cent deposit and refund on all beer and soft drink cans and bottles within five years, and to ban pop top beverage cans within one year. The materials used for beverage containers amount to 6% of all the aluminum and 6% of all the steel produced in this country and should be recycled, not thrown away. The Oregon ban on throw-away bottles and cans has reduced roadside litter by almost 40% and saved 1.4 trillion BTUs of energy each year while creating 365 new full time jobs. June 30, 1976. Rejected 26-60. The correct vote is yes.",Other
Air Pollution I,"(S. 3219) Clean Air Act Amendments. The vote is on the Bentsen amendment to reduce the performance warranty on auto emissions control devices from 5 years or 50,000 miles to 18 months or 18,000 miles. This would make the citizen rather than the auto companies bear the burden of paying for the maintenance and repair costs of the auto emission controls that are used to reduce air pollution. Conservationists opposed the amendment because it would reduce public cooperation inspection program to make sure that these devices were working. July 28, 1976. Rejected 45-51. The correct vote is no.",Air
Air Pollution II,"(S. 3219) Clean Air Act Amendments: The vote is on the Moss amendment to delete the Òno significant deterioration provisionsÓ in the Clean Air Act requiring protection of present pristine air and authorizing a one year study on the impact of such requirements. As written, the bill required that National Parks and wilderness areas of 5,000 acres or more meet strict Class I air quality standards. New power plants near these parks would have to use best available pollution control technology and be sited so as to protect the clean air of these regions. The Moss amendment would have removed all these requirements, and allowed EPA through regulation to permit clean air areas to be polluted up to the minimum standards now set for most large cities. These standards give only minimum protection and are probably not sufficient to guard against long term adverse effects on public health. The President supported the amendment. August 3, 1976. Rejected 31-63. The correct vote is no.",Air
Air Pollution III,"(S. 3219) Clean Air Act Amendments: The vote is on the Hart amendment to retain the original auto emissions standard for nitrogen oxides. The old Clean Air Act had allowed only .4 grams of nitrogen oxides per mile, but the bill relaxed this standard to 1.0 grams per mile. Nitrogen oxide can be a dangerous cancer causing pollutant. It reaches very high levels in many large cities during rush hours. A three way catalytic converter has already been developed for us in the 1977 Volvos which meets the .4 NOX standard. Yet the Volvo's fuel efficiency has increased by 10 percent. Environmentalists favor retaining the original standard. August 5, 1976. Rejected 33-58. The correct vote is yes.",Air
Aerosol Sprays,"(S. 3219) Clean Air Act Amendments: The vote is on the Packwood amendment to ban the use of fluorocarbons in aerosol cans and sprays after January 1, 1978, unless the Environmental Protection Agency decided that the chemicals pose no significant risk to public health or welfare. At the time of the vote there was growing evidence that fluorocarbons are breaking down the ozone layer in the stratosphere that protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation. Since the vote, this theory has been confirmed by a National Academy of Sciences panel which estimated that continued use of aerosol sprays would cause several thousand cases of skin cancer every year. The panel recommended tough restrictions on the use of fluorocarbons but did not set any deadline for this. August 5, 1976. Rejected 28-64. The correct vote is yes.",Air
National Forests,"(S. 3091) The National Forest Management Act: The vote is on the Humphrey motion to table and thus kill the Randolph amendment to reform forestry practices in the National Forests. The amendment would have required the Forest Service to consider the option of selective cutting in all National Forests, and to require selective cutting rather than clear-cutting in the eastern mixed hardwood National Forests. Large scale clear-cutting and Òeven-aged managementÓ forestry practices involve stripping an area of all its trees, causing erosion, loss of soil nutrients and stream siltation. Frequently the area is reforested with trees that are all the same species and age, resulting in a tree farm rather than a natural forest. Such areas are very vulnerable to disease and insect infestations and poorly suited for uses other than logging. August 25, 1976. Motion to table agreed 64-25. The correct vote is no.",Lands/Forests
Population,"(H.R. 14232) Labor and HEW Appropriations: The vote is on the Bayh motion urging that the Senate insist on its own language regarding abortions and refuse to give in to the House. The House language said that none of the money in the bill could be used to pay for or encourage abortions, not even where necessary to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. This denial of federal funds would simply deprive poor women of the right to choose that rich women already enjoy. A federal population Commission has stressed the need for broad public access to abortions in order to prevent unwanted children and slow down population growth. Environmentalists agree because overpopulation hastens the depletion of natural resources and is a root cause of nearly all environmental problems. August 25, 1976. Passed 53-35. The correct vote is yes.",Other
New River Dam,"(H.R. 13372) Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Amendments: The vote is on passage of the bill to add a 26 mile stretch of the New River in North Carolina and Virginia to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This would prevent the Federal Power Commission from allowing construction of a giant pumped storage dam to be used for power generation by the American Electric Power Company, a private utility. The New River is actually one of the oldest rivers in the world, with unique geological features, historical value, and excellent fishing and whitewater canoeing. The dam would have left more than 3,000 people homeless and was fought bitterly by farmers, fishermen and conservationists. The President supported the legislation. August 30, 1976. Passed 69-16. The correct vote is yes.","Water, Lands/Forests"
Wetlands Protection,"(S. 2710) Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1976. The vote is on the Tower amendment to reduce the authority of the Army Corps of Engineers to regulate the dredging and filling of wetlands through the ÒSection 404Ó permit program. The amendment would only allow the Corps to regulate about 25 percent of the nation's wetlands, and leave the rest to be regulated at the discretion of the states. But very few states have effective wetland protection programs. Marshes and wetlands are vital breeding grounds for fish, and the most productive natural habitat for wildlife. They also serve to cleanse pollution and work as buffers against flooding. Yet this amendment would so severely limit the permit program that federal agencies would be powerless to prevent widespread dredging and pollution of wetlands. For once, conservationists sided with the Corps of Engineers and opposed the amendment. September 1,1976. Rejected 39-40. The correct vote is no.",Water
Strip Mining I,"(S. 7): Surface Mine and Reclamation Act of 1975: The vote is on the Mansfield amendment to ban future strip mining in some parts of the west, and protected the rights of property owners who might otherwise be forced off their land. A National Academy of Science study concluded that most western states did not have enough water to support large scale coal development and that large areas would be impossible to reclaim for agriculture because the strip mining would destroy the soil and the aquifers. The President opposed the amendment. March 11, 1975. Rejected 39-56. The correct vote is yes.",Dirty Energy
Strip Mining II,"(S. 7): Surface Mine and Reclamation Act of 1975: The vote is on the McClure amendment to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to remove the ban on surface mining in the National Forests if he felt it was in the national interest. Both the House and Senate Interior Committees had forbidden strip mining in the National Forests because it violated the principles of multiple use. Even the best reclamation techniques cannot restore the full productivity of the soil for growing timber and other uses. The President supported the amendment. March 11, 1975. Rejected 27-68. The correct vote is No.",Dirty Energy
Strip Mining III,"(S. 7): Surface Mine and Reclamation Act of 1975: The vote is on the Mathias amendment to phase out strip mining on steep mountain slopes greater than 20 degrees. In a 1973 Senate study, a survey of landslides in Kentucky showed that 86% of the slides from strip mining were on slopes of 20 degrees or more, and that 3 to 5 acres of land are disturbed for every acre stripped on steep slopes. Environmentalists have attempted to include a 20 degree ban since the first strip mining bill was considered in 1972. The President had no position on the amendment. March 12, 1975. Rejected 28-64. The correct vote is yes.",Dirty Energy
Interior Secretary Confirmation,"The vote is on the Muskie motion to recommit the President's nomination of Stanley Hathaway to be Secretary of the Interior. This would have prevented Hathaway's confirmation by the Senate. Environmentalists opposed the nomination because Hathaway had a terrible record as former Governor of Wyoming. He wanted to open up every available acre of land owned by the state for coal and oil shale development. He opposed the addition of any new wilderness areas and advocated the building of a jet port in Grand Teton National Park. He pushed for increased clear-cutting in Wyoming forests, and for dams on the state's scenic rivers. His idea of predator control was to shoot eagles from aircraft. The President opposed the motion. June 11, 1975. Rejected 40-54. The correct vote is yes.",Other
Energy Conservation,"(S. 1883): Mandatory Fuel Economy Standards: The vote is on the Griffin motion to recommit (and thus kill) a bill to set general gas mileage standards for new cars and light duty trucks in model years 1977-1985. Automobiles consume over one-third of all petroleum used in the U.S. and are the single largest source of air pollution. Although the EPA and the Department of Transportation both believe that the bill's fuel economy standards were technologically and financially feasible, the Ford Administration opposed the bill and advocated a less stringent and voluntary program instead. July 15, 1975. Rejected 25-59. The correct vote is no.","Clean Energy, Transportation"
Coastal Development,"(S. 586): Coastal Zone Management Act Amendments: The vote is on the Bumpers amendment to limit federal aid that would encourage energy development along the coastline. As written, the bill provided federal impact aid to reimburse the states for all damages from all types of coastal energy facilities. Unfortunately this would give the states an incentive to concentrate energy development near estuaries and other fragile coastal areas. The Bumpers amendment restricted the impact aid to areas affected by offshore oil development, which must be located on the coast in any case. The President took no official position. July 16, 1975. Rejected 30-62. The correct vote is yes.","Drilling, Oceans"
Offshore Oil Drilling,"(S. 521) Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The vote is on the Jackson amendment to create an experimental federally funded program so that the Interior Department could contract out for exploratory oil drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. Until now the government has relied on oil company data to decide the value of offshore oil deposits, and could be leasing these tracts for much less than their true value. Conservationists believe that the government should get its own independent information, so it can weigh the environmental costs against the energy benefits in each case, and make sure that the public gets a fair return on its land. Most new parks and recreation areas are paid for by the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is financed by revenues from offshore oil leasing. The President took no official position on the amendment. July 30, 1975. Adopted 46-41. The correct vote is yes.",Drilling
Breeder Nuclear Reactor,"(S. 598) Energy Research Authorizations: The vote is on the Montoya motion to keep in the bill $94.1 million in authorizations for equipment for the Clinch River demonstration breeder reactor. Scientists consider the proposed breeder nuclear reactor to be much more dangerous than the conventional nuclear reactors now in use. A malfunction in the breeder could trigger an explosion, and the plutonium produced by the breeder could be used by terrorists to make nuclear bombs. At the time of the vote, there was no final design for the Clinch River plant, several studies on the breeder were not yet completed, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had ordered a moratorium on the recycle of plutonium -- a process essential to the breeder. Environmentalists argued that funding for the breeder should be spent on further research rather than on equipment that might commit the nation to construction of the breeder before the safety problems were solved. Motion adopted 66-30. July 31, 1975. The correct vote is NO.",Dirty Energy
Solar Energy,"(S. 598) Energy Research Authorizations: The vote is on the Gravel amendment to increase authorization for solar energy research and development from $96 million to $158 million for fiscal 1976. Solar power is one of the safest and least polluting forms of energy available. Although the solar energy budget was less than some previous agency predictions of need, the Energy Research and Development Administration said that any funding increase would be throwing money away on a program already well-funded. The President took no official position. July 31, 1975. Rejected 34-59. The correct vote is yes.",Clean Energy
Oil Industry Break-Up,"(S. 2310) Emergency Natural Gas Act: The vote is on the Kennedy amendment to require major oil companies to divest themselves of their interests in alternative energy sources within three years. Large oil conglomerates have been buying up huge supplies of coal, uranium and oil shale reserves, in an effort to gain more total control over shale, coal gasification and other destructive, expensive energy sources which only they can afford to produce; thus their breakup would probably slow down development of these sources. Environmentalists prefer solar heat, wind, and other small scale energy sources which invite competition, and they favor breaking up conglomerates to reduce their power over national energy policies. The President took no official position. October 22, 1975. Rejected 39-53. The correct vote is yes.",Dirty Energy
Dickey-Lincoln Dam,"(H.R. 8122) Public Works Energy Research Appropriations: The vote is on the Brooke amendment to remove the funds for the Dickey Lincoln hydroelectric project in northern Maine. The dam would flood 140 square miles of wilderness and destroy thousands of acres of recreational streams. Economists estimate that the costs of Dickey Lincoln would run 60% to 80% higher than a fossil fuel plant of the same capacity. The project would operate only 3 hours a day to accommodate peak loads and would consume more energy than it produced. The President took no official positions. December 5, 1975. Rejected 13-73. The correct vote is yes.","Lands/Forests, Water, Wildlife"
Highway Trust Fund,"(S. 2711) Federal Aid Highway Program: The vote is on the Kennedy-Weicker amendment to permit states and localities to use additional categories of Highway Trust Fund money for mass transit. The bill already allowed cities with polluted air and congested streets to turn back money allocated for Interstate Highways and receive mass transit money instead. The amendment would go further than this and allow cities to use Trust Fund money for primary and secondary roads for mass transit also. Conservationists believe localities need the freedom to develop whatever transportation systems best suit their needs. The President took no official position. December 12, 1975. Rejected 26-61 Correct vote is yes.",Transportation
Nuclear Accident Insurance,"(S. 2568) Price-Anderson Nuclear Insurance Act Amendments: The vote is on the Gravel amendment to give victims of nuclear accidents the right to sue for additional damages under existing laws that cover ordinary damage suits. As written, the Act set up a federally subsidized nuclear insurance program, and prohibited citizens from recovering any damages of over $560 million per accident. Yet studies show that a really serious accident could cost billions. Conservationists fear that low liability limits will reduce the nuclear industry's motivation to act with caution. If people must accept the human risks of nuclear energy, why can't utilities accept the financial risk? December 16, 1975. Rejected 34-62. The correct vote is yes.",Dirty Energy
Water Projects,"Water Resources and River Basin Monetary Authorization Act of 1975 (S. 2798). The vote is on the Buckley amendment to raise the discount rate to 6 and 7/8 percent for all the projects authorized in the bill. This would allow a much more realistic evaluation of the true costs and benefits of dams, canals, and other potentially destructive water projects. A coalition of 13 environmental organizations recommended that the discount rate be set at 10% to compare with private interest rates, but the government still pretends that interest costs less than 6% when evaluating water projects. The Buckley amendment would eliminate many of the projects now authorized, and save the taxpayers billions of dollars. The President supported the amendment. January 22, 1974. Rejected 21-63. YES is the correct vote.",Water
New River,"Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Amendments of 1973 (S. 2439). The vote is on the passage of the bill to provide a two year study of 70 miles of the New River in North Carolina and Virginia for possible inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system. Enactment of the bill would block construction of two dams on the river intended to provide electric power. Many environmental organizations opposed the project because it would displace thousands of residents and disrupt one of the last remaining unpolluted free flowing rivers in the East -- also one of the oldest rivers in the world. The President took no position on the amendment, but the Interior Department which initially opposed the bill later supported it. May 28, 1974. Passed 49-19. YES is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Right to Know,"Amendments to the Freedom of Information Act (H.R. 12471). The vote is on the Hart amendment to limit the grounds under which records compiled for law enforcement purposes could be withheld from the public. The amendment would shift the burden of proof from citizens to the government, to show that information sought would directly impair enforcement proceedings or deprive a person of basic constitutional rights. Under present law, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency will give polluters information about their violation of the Clean Air Act, but keep it secret from the public until after they have already reached a compromise agreement with the industry. The amendment will enable citizens to better participate in enforcement actions in many federal pollution laws. The Nixon Administration took no position on the amendment. Adopted 51-33. May 30, 1974. YES is the correct vote.","Toxics/Public Right to Know, Other"
Abortion,"Department of Defense Appropriations Authorization Act of 1975 (S. 3000). The vote is on the Stannis amendment to kill the Helms amendment which would have barred the use of federal funds for abortions, abortion referral services, transportation to abortion clinics, or any medical assistance used in connection with abortions. Although Helms did not admit it, the amendment was not limited to military personnel, but was a total prohibition on all federal program funds used in connection with abortions. The President's Population Commission has stressed the need for broad public access to abortions in order to slow down population growth. Most environmental groups agree because overpopulation hastens the depletion of resources and is a root cause of nearly all environmental problems. June 11, 1974. Motion to table agreed to 64-27. YES is the correct vote.",Other
Land Conservation,"National Resources Land Management Act of 1974 (S. 424). The vote is on the McClure amendment to rob the Secretary of Interior of his discretionary authority to impose conditions on private utilities and other permitees using National Resources Lands, except where he is expressly authorized by law. (The National Resources Lands were formerly called BLM lands.) Conservationists feared the amendment would have a broader impact and cloud the Secretary's authority to protect adjacent lands, to implement pollution control laws, or to carry out the kind of broad integrative analysis called for by NEPA. The Nixon Administration opposed the amendment. July 8, 1974. Rejected 23-47. NO is the correct vote.",Lands/Forests
Sewage Treatment Funds,"Agricultural, Environmental and Consumer Protection Appropriations Act for fiscal 1975. The vote is on the McGee motion to kill the Nelson amendment to appropriate $700 million to reimburse states and cities for the cost of constructing sewage treatment plants. After Congress passed the Water Pollution Control Act in 1956, many cities used their own money to construct treatment plants in anticipation of matching federal money. But some of these funds were never paid. In 1973, the Senate had already authorized but not appropriated sufficient funds to pay the cities back. If the federal government fails to honor these commitments it will discourage other localities from taking any initiative on other pollution laws in the future. President Nixon supported the McGee motion to remove the funds. July 22, 1974. Motion agreed to 45-43. NO is the correct vote.",Water
Herbicide,"Interior Department Appropriations for fiscal 1975 (H.R. 16027). The vote is on the Nelson amendment to prohibit the use of herbicide 2,4,5-T (a major component of Agent Orange) in the National Forests. The Forest Service planned to use 2,4,5-T in 61 National Forests in 23 states for fire protection and promotion of timber growth by eradicating the competing undergrowth. 2,4,5-T contains TCDD, a substance 1000 times more toxic than the nerve gas VX. Some studies show that TCDD is persistent and builds up in the food chain, while others show that residues disappear quickly. The Environmental Protection Agency stated that because ""the long term levels of TCDD remain undetermined, an acceptable level cannot be set."" The Nelson amendment would prevent the use of this chemical in National Forests until more conclusive studies are made. President Nixon took no position on the amendment. August 7, 1974. Rejected 34-56. YES is the correct vote.",Toxics/Public Right to Know
Nuclear Liability,"Amendments to the Price-Anderson Indemnity Provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (H.R. 15323). The bill sets a maximum limit of $560 million in damages to be paid to affected communities in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. The AEC charges each plant from $2 to $5 million in deferred insurance premiums to pay for damages as they occur. Yet damages from a really serious accident could cost billions, and such low liability limits help to insulate the nuclear power industry from the consequences of a disaster and to reduce its motivation for safety. The vote is on the Schweiker amendment to permit states to impose stricter liability and insurance requirements on nuclear plants in their areas. Environmentalists argued that different plants have different degrees of risk, and so liability and insurance costs should be higher for those in dangerous locations or near large populations. President Nixon opposed the amendment. August 8, 1974. Rejected 28-60. YES is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Highway Trust Fund I,"Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 (S. 502). The vote is on the Kennedy-Weicker amendment to give cities and states the option of using up to $2.3 billion a year in Highway Trust Fund money for bus and rail transportation as well as for highways. This far reaching agreement would result in cleaner air, more efficient use of energy, and better services for the 22% of American households who have no automobiles. Cars are now directly responsible for over 40% of all air pollution. This amendment did not shift any money from rural to urban areas, but merely allowed each area to spend on the kind of transportation that it needed most. The President took no position on the amendment. March 14, 1973. Rejected 23-70. Yes is the correct vote.",Transportation
Highway Trust Fund II,"Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 (S. 502). The vote is on the Muskie-Baker compromise amendment that would allow cities and states up to $850 million a year in Highway Trust Fund money for rail transportation as well as for buses and highways. More than 20 environmental, consumer, civil rights, and civic organizations supported this measure as a ""necessary step toward providing an efficient, balanced, safe, and environmentally sound national transportation system."" The President supported the amendment. March 14, 1973. Adopted 49-44. Yes is the correct vote.",Transportation
Highway Construction,"Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 (S. 502). The vote is on the Buckley amendment to strike out a section of the bill which overturned a federal court decision stopping construction of a freeway through the Breckenridge Olmos Basin Park in San Antonio, Texas. This freeway violates both the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 4F of the 1966 Transportation Act which forbids highways through parklands unless there is no feasible alternative. As written, the bill allows the Texas Highway Department to ignore both these laws. The President supported the amendment. March 15, 1973. Rejected 43-50. Yes is the correct vote.",Transportation
Land Use I,"Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance Act of 1973 (S. 268). The vote is on the Jackson amendment to provide a phased reduction of federal aid to highways, airports, and other growth inducing facilities in states that fail to develop their own land use planning programs. The amendment provides a powerful incentive for states to get going on their own land use programs. Once they do, any money previously denied to them under the Jackson amendment would be fully restored. The President took no position on the amendment. June 20, 1973. Rejected 44-52.

Land Use II,"Land Use Policy and Planning Assistance Act of 1973 (S. 268). The vote is on passage of the bill, to provide grants to the states to establish land use planning programs that would regulate development in areas of ""critical environmental concern"" and around key facilities such as airports and highway interchanges. One provision would require the participating states to regulate large subdivisions such as second home developments. Environmentalists strongly supported the legislation as a means to control irresponsible and destructive development. The Nixon administration also supported the bill. June 21, 1973. Passed 64-21.

The amendment also called for an eight month study of both routes before Congress finally decided which one should be used. Letters sent to the Senate following this vote confirmed that the State Department had concealed Canada's willingness to negotiate a trans-Canadian pipeline.

The vote is on the Gravel amendment to prevent judicial review of the pipeline or related permits issued by the Secretary of Interior. Environmentalists opposed the amendment because in the words of Senator Jackson, ""it exempted the pipeline from contracts law, securities, and many other laws, and would set a dangerous precedent to exempt a project, which all parties admit represents a potential threat to the environment, from the requirements of environmental law."" The President did not take a position on the amendment, but did oppose a similar provision in the House. July 17, 1973. Adopted 49-48. No is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Mass Transit I,"Emergency Commuter Relief Act of 1973 (S. 386). The vote is on the passage of the bill to authorize $800 million for fiscal 1974-75 for grants to states and localities for urban mass transit operating subsidies. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1973 provided funds for construction of new mass transit systems, but nothing for the costs of operating them. Without operating subsidies, many bus and rail systems could not set fares low enough to encourage the heavy public use that is essential to conserve fuel and reduce air pollution. The President opposed the amendment. September 10, 1973. Adopted 53-33. Yes is the correct vote.",Transportation
Strip Mining I,"Surface Mine Reclamation Act of 1973 (S. 425). The vote is on the Mansfield amendment to prohibit coal surface mining on homesteaded lands, where the government owns the mineral rights but not the surface rights. This protected the rights of property owners who might otherwise be forced off their land. The amendment would have prevented strip mining in large areas of the West, but did not apply to deep mining. Since 90% of the nation's coal can only be recovered by deep mining, the amendment would have little long term impact on U.S. energy production. A National Academy of Sciences study concluded that many states did not have enough water to support coal gasification plants and other large energy projects needed to process and use large amounts of strip mined coal in the West. October 8, 1973. Adopted 53-33. Yes is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Strip Mining II,"Surface Mine Reclamation Act of 1973 (S. 425). The vote is on the Allen amendment to gut the requirement in the bill that all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions be eliminated. Retention of highwalls isolates the land above the mine site, making it unstable and useless. The Council on Environmental Quality has strongly urged that they be eliminated and this has been required in the Pennsylvania law since 1964. If spoil piles are left after mining, they cause serious erosion. Senator Nelson said that ""this is the very guts of the most important part of the bill."" The President did not take a position on the amendment. October 9, 1973. Rejected 29-63. No is the correct vote.",Dirty Energy
Lease Sale EIS Waivers,"National Emergency Energy Act of 1973 (S. 2589). The vote is on the Hansen amendment to waive the requirement for complete Environmental Impact Statements on the sale of leases on federal lands for oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy. These include the offshore oil leases on the Outer Continental Shelf with their potential for serious oil slicks. Hansen claimed that his amendment would speed up energy development, but environmentalists countered that delays were not caused by NEPA, but because federal agencies needed more time to gather geological and other scientific information. Russell Peterson, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, testified in hearings that he did not think NEPA would cause any delay in the Outer Continental Shelf leasing program. The President supported the amendment. November 19, 1973. Rejected 21-64. No is the correct vote.","Drilling, Dirty Energy, Other"
Auto Emissions,"Clean Air Standards Extension (S. 2772). The vote is on the Scott amendment to postpone implementation of the 1976 auto emission standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide until 1978. The automobile industry claimed that breathing more poisonous air would save us fuel, because the lead free gasoline required by cars with catalytic converters would result in a loss of one million gallons of oil per day. But an A.D. Little study showed that there was no loss of fuel in the production of lead-free gasoline. Furthermore the catalytic converters used to cut down on pollution would also get better mileage per gallon than the 1974 models do now. The President supported the amendment. December 17, 1973. Rejected 19-67. NO is the correct vote.","Air, Transportation"
Flood Plain Development,"Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1974 (H.R. 8449). The bill provides flood insurance subsidies for existing flood plain development, but not for most new development. The vote is on the Johnston amendment to continue these subsidies for the owners of existing subdivisions who want to keep building on the 40 year flood level. Environmentalists opposed the amendment because it would encourage further development of the flood plains, and spur the government to build more dams and flood control projects. The dams often inundate scenic and fertile valleys, disrupt wildlife and destroy the use of the flood plain downstream to absorb run-off. Damage by floods has actually increased in many areas where these projects were built. The President opposed the amendment. December 18, 1973. Rejected 23-68. NO is the correct vote.","Lands/Forests, Water"
Mass Transit,"Housing and Urban Development Act of 1972 (S 3248). The vote is on the Allott amendment to delete $800 million in contract obligation authority to pay for urban mass transit operating expenses. Without federal aid to help pay operating expenses, subway and bus systems in many cities would be forced to shut down. The Nixon Administration supported the amendment. (Rejected 26-53. March 2, 1972. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Transportation
Nuclear Radiation Standards,"Nuclear Reactor Temporary Operating License Act (HR 14655). The vote is on the Schweiker amendment to allow the states to set stricter radiation standards for nuclear power plants than those set by the Atomic Energy Commission. (The states could not allow anything weaker than the federal standards.) The White House took no position on this amendment. (Rejected 36-41. May 17, 1972. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)",Dirty Energy
TSCA,"Toxic Substances Control Act of 1972 (S 1478). This bill requires pre-market testing of potentially dangerous chemicals and gives the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to restrict or ban their commercial use. The vote is on the Baker amendment to limit pre-market testing and restrictions to only those chemicals which EPA ""has reason to believe may pose an unreasonable threat...under intended and normal circumstances of use..."" Under this amendment, a chemical could be marketed without testing, simply because its hazards were not yet known. The Nixon Administration took no position. (Rejected 28-43. May 30, 1972. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Toxics/Public Right to Know
OSHA Exemptions,"Labor and HEW Appropriations for fiscal 1973 (HR 15417). The vote is on the Curtis amendment to prohibit the use of funds in the bill for inspection of firms employing 25 or fewer persons for compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Nixon Administration was opposed to the amendment. (Rejected 41-44. June 27, 1972. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Other
Marine Mammal Protections I,"Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (S 2871). Under the bill no person may kill any marine mammals, nor import their products, without a permit issued according to specified regulations. The bill established a moratorium on the granting of permits and the killing of marine mammals, but it gave the federal agencies complete discretion to disregard the moratorium. This could result in widespread commercial killing. The vote is on the Williams amendment to forbid the federal administrators from issuing any permits except for scientific and educational purposes. (Rejected 36-52. July 25, 1972. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)","Wildlife, Oceans"
Marine Mammal Protections II,"Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (S 2871). The vote is on the Hart amendment to give the Secretary of Interior jurisdiction over all species of marine mammals, rather than dividing the jurisdiction between the Departments of Interior and Commerce. Conservationists believe that the Interior Department would be more sympathetic to the plight of marine mammals than the Commerce Department. The Administration opposed the Hart amendment. (Rejected 38-48. July 25, 1972. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)","Wildlife, Oceans"
Highway Construction,"Federal Aid Highway Act of 1972 (S 3939). The vote is on the Buckley amendment to remove a section of the bill that would overturn a federal court decision and allow construction of a freeway through the Breckenridge-Olmos Basin Parklands in San Antonio, Texas. The U.S. Court of Appeals had prohibited construction on the grounds that federal and state agencies failed to investigate alternatives and it violated the National Environmental Policy Act and the parklands protection provisions of the Department of Transportation Act. The bill set a dangerous precedent for exempting local projects from federal environmental laws. The Nixon Administration took no position. (Rejected 24-49. September 13, 1972. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)","Transportation, Lands/Forests"
Land Use II,"Land Use Planning and Local Assistance Act (S 632). The vote is on the Miller amendment to strike out provisions requiring the states to include public participation at all stages of the land use planning process. The Nixon Administration took no position. (Rejected 35-41. September 19, 1972. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Lands/Forests
Land Use I,"Land Use Planning and Local Assistance Act (S 632). The bill set up a system of federal grants to states to support land use planning programs. The vote is on the Muskie amendment to add specific land use policy criteria to restrict development on wetlands, flood plains, and rich agricultural lands, and to forbid developments that overtax existing sewer, power, or transportation systems. The Nixon Administration took no position. (Rejected 14-61. September 19, 1972. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)",Lands/Forests
Land Use III,"Land Use Planning and Local Assistance Act (S 632). The vote is on the Jordan amendment to slash funding for the bill from $100 million annually for eight years to $40 million annually for the first two years and $30 million annually for the next five years. Most of the money in the bill would be given to the states; however, the bill lacked federal guidelines or sanctions strong enough to ensure good state programs. The Nixon Administration supported the amendment. (Adopted 44-35. September 19, 1972. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Lands/Forests
Highway Trust Fund II,"Federal Aid Highway Act of 1972 (S 3939). The bill authorized over $6 billion from the Highway Trust Fund for road construction. Of this amount, $2 billion could be used on a local option basis for bus transportation. The vote is on the Cooper-Muskie amendment to allow $800 million in the Urban Systems Fund to be used for rail transit as well as buses and highways. The Nixon Administration supported the amendment. (Adopted 48-26. September 19, 1972. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)",Transportation
SST,"Department of Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal 1971 (H.J. Res 468). The vote is on the Senate Appropriations Committee amendment to restore $134 million for continued financing of two prototype supersonic transport planes (The SST). The Nixon Administration supported the amendment. (Rejected 46-51. March 24, 1971. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Transportation
Pesticides,"Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Appropriations bill for fiscal 1972 (HR 9270). The vote is on the Nelson amendment to remove $7.8 million for the Department of Agriculture's massive fire ant control program, which included widespread aerial spraying of the pesticide Mirex over 120 million acres in the southeastern U.S. Before this vote occurred, the Environmental Protection Agency had already cancelled the registration of Mirex because it was extremely toxic and more persistent in human tissue than DDT. (Rejected 28-53; July 15, 1971; ""Yes"" is the correct vote.","Toxics/Public Right to Know, Lands/Forests"
Nuclear Testing,"Atomic Energy Commission Authorizations (HR 9388). The vote is on the Gravel amendment to delay the Project Cannikan nuclear blast on Amchitka Island, Alaska, until May 31, 1972. Conservationists opposed the blast because of the risks of earthquakes, radioactive leakage into the ocean, and damage to endangered wildlife. The Nixon Administration opposed the Gravel amendment. (Rejected 37-57; July 20, 1971; ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)","Dirty Energy, Oceans, Wildlife"
Water Projects,"Public Works and Atomic Energy Appropriations for fiscal 1971 (HR 10090). The vote is on the Nelson amendment to withhold funds for construction of four watershed projects until February 1, 1972 because the agencies involved failed to file adequate environmental impact statements. The amendment defended the integrity of the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires that comprehensive environmental impact statements be completed before such projects are begun. These four projects would dam and channelize very beautiful free flowing eastern rivers. They are: the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in Alabama and Mississippi, the Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River, the Duck River Dams in Tennessee, and the La Farge Dam on the Kickaroo River in Wisconsin. (Amendment rejected 17-56; July 31, 1971; ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)",Water
Navy Electrical Grid,"Defense Procurement Authorization bill (HR 8687). The vote is on the Nelson amendment to withhold nearly all the funding for Project Sanguine, pending a full review of its feasibility and its environmental impact. This is a Navy proposal for an underground electrical grid covering vast areas of northern Wisconsin to be used for submarine communications. Nobody knows what the continuous low-frequency current would do to the nervous systems of living organisms above and below the ground. (Rejected 35-45; September 22, 1971; ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)",Wildlife
Waste Water Treatment,"Water Pollution Control bill (S 2770). The bill gives the Environmental Protection Agency contract authority to guarantee federal payment of 60-75% of the costs of waste treatment plants. The vote is on the Boggs amendment to require annual Congressional appropriations for waste water treatment, instead of using contract authority. This makes EPA's future funding uncertain, and discourages long range efforts by cities and states who depend on the federal government to pay its share. (Rejected 34-58; November 2, 1971; ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Water
Highway Trust Fund I,"Revenue Act of 1971 (HR 10947). The vote is on the Percy amendment to delete a provision earmarking 7% of the federal alcohol tax revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. This would add another $350 million a year to the Trust Fund, which already spends about $5 billion a year exclusively on highway construction at the expense of other forms of transportation. The Nixon Administration supported the amendment. (Rejected 43-46. November 16, 1971. ""Yes"" is the correct vote.)",Transportation
Butz Confirmation,"Vote on the confirmation of  Dr. Earl L. Butz as Secretary of Agriculture. (Executive Report 92-13). This is a key environmental position, since the Agriculture Department controls federal policies on forestry, stream channelization, and farming practices, and has partial jurisdiction over pesticides. Dr. Butz is a friend of big agribusiness corporations that are driving the small farmer off the land and promoting farming methods that increase our dependency on pesticides. His nomination was opposed not only by environmental groups, but also by farm and consumer organizations. Butz is openly antagonistic to the environmental movement, calling it ""the real threat to American agriculture."" (Nomination confirmed 51-44. December 2, 1971. ""No"" is the correct vote.)",Other
